<ul>
  <li>This British news film was shot in 1967. It was not directly about Vietnam,
    but about dissent and protest in the USA. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The main feature of the programme was Ronald Reagan. Reagan was a former
    Hollywood actor who became governor of California in 1967. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Reagan represented the far right wing of US politics. He was extremely anti-Communist
    and held very traditional views on politics, family and other social issues.
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Reagan was a hate figure for left wing students in the USA in the late 1960s.
    The 1960s were a time of increasing liberalism in the USA. This was shown
    by the Hippy movements, music by artists such as the Beatles or Bob Dylan,
    freer attitudes to sex and the use of drugs. <br>
  </li>
  <li>At the same time, many students felt that their own country had gone wrong.
    They saw the Vietnam War as unjustifiable and were angry at being called up
    to serve in it. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Reagan saw the student protesters as dangerous and disloyal to their country.
    Reagan and his supporters did not believe the USA should leave Vietnam, but
    should take the war further by actually invading North Vietnam.</li>
