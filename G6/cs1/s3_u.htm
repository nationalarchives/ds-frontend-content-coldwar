<ul>
  <li>This document is a transcript of a conversation between Dwight Eisenhower,
    US President in 1954, and an American reporter, Robert Richards.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Eisenhower was a highly respected President, and was formerly the Supreme
    Commander of Allied forces during the Second World War. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Domino Theory originated from the late 1940s when Stalin managed to
    install Communist rulers in many Eastern European states. The US President
    at the time was Truman, who developed the policy of Containment. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Containment meant that the USA would do all it could to try to stop the
    spread of Communism to any new states. The Domino Theory made it clear that
    if Communism was not stopped, other states would follow. <br>
  </li>
  <li>This policy was the guiding view behind President Kennedy's policies almost
    ten years later, when he increased US involvement in Vietnam. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Robert McNamara was one of Kennedy's top advisers. He was interviewed much
    later and said that neither he nor the President or any other US politician
    questioned the policy until well after the war finally ended. They just assumed
    it was right. <br>
  </li>
