</p>
<p>As regards the particularly difficult problem of Vietnam, the United States
  spokesmen had made it clear that the measures which they had recently taken
  to attack targets in the northern half of the country were directed solely to
  arresting the progressive infiltration of South Vietnam by the VietCong forces
  and that the statement by General Maxwell-Taylor, the United States representative
  in Saigon, that there was no limit to the potential increase of the war, should
  not be interpreted as inconsistent with this policy. </p>
<p>They regarded themselves as having no alternative to this course of action.
  They could not contemplate the evacuation of Vietnam, except at the unacceptable
  price of allowing Communist influence to extend progressively throughout South-East
  Asia. </p>
<p>They regarded it as equally impracticable that they should remain in South
  Vietnam but refrain from any counter-action to arrest the infiltration of the
  VietCong forces. In these circumstances the only course open to them was to
  strike at those forces in the area from which they came. They appeared fully
  to appreciate the risks inherent in this course, particularly the length of
  time which might elapse before the Government of North Vietnam were finally
  deterred from further aggression and the danger that, in this interval, the
  Government of South Vietnam might itself collapse. </p>
<p>They regarded these risks, however, as outweighed by the imperative need to
  check the North Vietnamese advance. Nevertheless, they did not intend to attack
  North Vietnam with ground forces; and they had undertaken to inform us in advance
  if they contemplated any extension of their present policy of air attack.</p>
<p>So far there was no indication that the mounting United States pressure was
  causing the Government of North Vietnam to be more ready to contemplate negotiation
  as a means of ending the conflict. The United States Government were equally
  unwilling to contemplate negotiation unless infiltration by Viet Cong forces
  ceased and satisfactory evidence to this effect could be produced. </p>
<p>As regards the recent occasion on which United States troops had used gas against
  the Viet Cong forces, he had left the United States Administration in no doubt
  of the strength of public feeling on this point in the United Kingdom and the
  extent to which, in our view, the episode had damaged the international reputation
  of the United States. In fact, however, the United States Government themselves
  had not been consulted by the local Commander before the weapons in question
  were brought into use; and the gas in question had been only the non-lethal
  type, which had been used by many countries, including ourselves, for the control
  of civil disturbances. <br>
