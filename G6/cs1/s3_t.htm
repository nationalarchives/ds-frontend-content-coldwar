<p>Q. Robert Richards, Copley Press: Mr. President, would you mind commenting 
  on the strategic importance of Indochina to the free world? I think there has 
  been, across the country, some lack of understanding on just what it means to 
  us. </p>
<p>The President: You have, of course, both the specific and the general when 
  you talk about such things. First of all, you have the specific value of a locality 
  in its production of materials that the world needs. </p>
<p>Then you have the possibility that many human beings pass under a dictatorship 
  that is inimical to the free world.</p>
<p>Finally, you have broader considerations that might follow what you would call 
  the &quot;falling domino&quot; principle. You have a row of dominoes set up, 
  you knock over the first one, and what will happen to the last one is the certainty 
  that it will go over very quickly. So you could have a beginning of a disintegration 
  that would have the most profound influences. </p>
<p>Now, with respect to the first one, two of the items from this particular area 
  that the world uses are tin and tungsten. They are very important. There are 
  others, of course, the rubber plantations and so on. </p>
<p>Then with respect to more people passing under this domination, Asia, after 
  all, has already lost some 450 million of its peoples to the Communist dictatorship, 
  and we simply can't afford greater losses. </p>
<p>But when we come to the possible sequence of events, the loss of Indochina, 
  of Burma, of Thailand, of the Peninsula, and Indonesia following, now you begin 
  to talk about areas that not only multiply the disadvantages that you would 
  suffer through loss of materials, sources of materials, but now you are talking 
  about millions and millions and millions of people. </p>
<p>Finally, the geographical position achieved thereby does many things. It turns 
  the so-called island defensive chain of Japan, Formosa, of the Philippines and 
  to the southward; it moves in to threaten Australia and New Zealand. </p>
<p>It takes away, in its economic aspects, that region that Japan must have as 
  a trading area or Japan, in turn, will have only one place in the world to go 
  that is, toward the Communist areas in order to live. </p>
<p>So, the possible consequences of the loss are just incalculable to the free 
  world.<br>
