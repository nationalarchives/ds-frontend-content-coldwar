<p>SECTION X<br>
  ARMED STRUGGLE (FIRST PHASE 1947-49)<br>
  &#133;<br>
  Ho Chi Minh's tactics had been successful in persuading certain sections of
  French opinion of his position as a genuine nationalist leader. Not unsurprisingly,
  they were even more successful in other countries of Asia, where the Viet Minh
  was genuinely held to be a coalition of nationalist groups opposed to imperialism
  &#133; rather than a fa&ccedil;ade concealing the manoeuvres of a powerful Communist
  group which was rapidly eliminating all political rivals. <br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>SECTION XIII <br>
  OPEN ALLEGIANCE WITH THE SOVIET BLOC<br>
  &#133; recent speeches by Ho have been in the same vein. In a speech in April,
  1952 (Viet Minh broadcast April 5 1952) he referred to Comrades Stalin and Mao
  Tse Tung as 'the most clear sighted, the most worthy elder brothers, friends
  of mankind.' <br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>SECTION XIV <br>
  RECENT TRENDS - EXPANSION<br>
  Since 1950 there have been signs of two new trends in Communist policy in Indo-China.
  The Viet Minh has turned its attention to the two non-Vietnamese states of Cambodia
  and Laos, and there has been an increased emphasis on the peasants. </p>
<p>&#133; The first sign of this new peasant policy was an article &#133; which
  stated that 'the most important prerequisite for the consolidation of the patriotic
  forces of Viet Nam is the carrying out of agrarian reform and the distribution
  of land to the peasants.' This theme was also stressed by Ho Chi Minh in his
  anniversary message. </p>
<p>&#133; Since the great majority of the people of Vietnam were peasants, and
  since they formed 'the pillars of the resistance movement,' it was necessary
  to 'favour the peasants in every way.'</p>
<p>SECTION XV <br>
  CONCLUSION<br>
  &#133; it can be seen that within the many tactical subterfuges and complexities
  which have been necessary, Ho Chi Minh has pursued a consistent policy which
  reveals him as an orthodox Communist political activist who devoted his career
  to gaining control of Indo-Chinese nationalism. </p>
<p>He is dedicated to turning this nationalism into a revolutionary movement in
  the Communist pattern, which if successful, will draw Indo-China into the Communist
  bloc and substantially increase the future threat of Communism in adjacent Asian
  territories. <br>
