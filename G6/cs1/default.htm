      <p><b>Background</b><br>
        The roots of the Vietnam conflict went back a long way. The whole area 
        of Indochina (see map) had been ruled by France before the Second World 
        War. During the war Japan took control of the area. Vietnamese Nationalists 
        (who wanted an independent Vietnam run by Vietnamese people), led by Ho 
        Chi Minh, fought the Japanese invaders. They used guerrilla tactics - 
        ambushes, hit and run raids etc. </p>

      <p>When the Japanese pulled out of Indochina in 1945 Ho declared Vietnam 
        to be an independent republic. However, the French did not accept this 
        and tried to re-establish their control. Ho Chi Minh's forces (Viet Minh) 
        then used the same tactics against the French, eventually defeating them 
        in 1954. Peace talks followed, and in 1954 the country was divided into 
        <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>North Vietnam ruled by Ho Chi Minh<br>
        </li>
        <li>South Vietnam, hostile to Ho and supported by the USA.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>The USA and Vietnam</b><br>
      Ho Chi Minh defeated the French even though the USA had provided massive 
      support in money and equipment. 
      <p>They did this because Ho Chi Minh was a Communist. America saw this as 
        another example of Communism trying to spread its influence. Ho Chi Minh 
        saw the conflict as a struggle to get foreigners out of his country, but 
        the USA did not accept his viewpoint.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Throughout the 1950s American thinking was based on the Domino Theory. 
        This meant that if one Asian state fell to Communism the rest would follow. 
        So, the USA had to stop the process. In 1954 the USA and numerous allies 
        formed SEATO - an Asian equivalent of NATO. From 1954 onwards they poured 
        money and resources into South Vietnam, determined that it would not become 
        a Communist state. </p>
      <p>South Vietnam was not an easy state to support. The South Vietnam government 
        was corrupt and unpopular. As a result, anti-government forces called 
        the National Liberation Front (also called Viet Cong) gained support among 
        ordinary Vietnamese. Ho Chi Minh supported these rebels and soon South 
        Vietnam was a state under siege. </p>
      <p>In the early 1960s President Kennedy sent increasing numbers of US military 
        'advisers' to help South Vietnam to fight the Viet Cong. US forces in 
        the region grew steadily, but the South Vietnamese were unable to defeat 
        the Viet Cong. The Viet Cong attacked government targets and officials, 
        and soon began to attack US targets and personnel as well. </p>
      <p>In 1964 North Vietnamese boats attacked US warships in the Gulf of Tonkin. 
        President Johnson got the approval of the US Congress to take any necessary 
        action. It was the first step to war. In 1965 Johnson ordered US Marines 
        ashore at Da Nang and the Vietnam War officially began. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>Your Task</b><br>
        With hindsight, we know that America's decision to get involved in Vietnam 
        was disastrous. Critics of the US government's actions in Vietnam raised 
        a number of points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>US policy was based on the Domino Theory, and there was no proof that 
          the Domino Theory was actually correct. <br>
        </li>
        <li>US policies were not clear - Johnson and Kennedy were not sure what 
          they were trying to achieve in Vietnam<br>
        </li>
        <li>South Vietnam was not a good ally. It was a corrupt state which did 
          not have the support of its own people. <br>
        </li>
        <li>The US forces were overconfident that their manpower and firepower 
          would defeat the Viet Cong. <br>
        </li>
        <li>America's allies and even her own people had doubts about US policy. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use the sources in this Case Study to decide</p>
      <ul>
        <li>whether you feel that these criticisms are correct<br>
        </li>
        <li>whether they could only be seen with hindsight or whether US leaders 
          should have seen the problems at the time. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> The worksheet will help you to organise your work. </p>
