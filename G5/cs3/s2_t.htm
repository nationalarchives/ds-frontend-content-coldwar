<p>NEW YEAR DEMONSTRATION AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR <br>
  JOIN THE NON-VIOLENT PROTEST AGAINST ALL NUCLEAR ARMAMENTS AT HARRINGTON ROCKET
  BASE (NORTHANTS)<br>
  ON SATURDAY, JANUARY 2ND 1960<br>
  PLEASE RAISE THIS WITH YOUR ORGANISATION</p>
<p>Nuclear disarmament was not an Election issue. People were more concerned about
  their purses than about the possibility of a Third World War. And so it is imperative
  that we renew our efforts to bring home to the general public and the Government
  the peril in which we live today, and our determination that weapons of mass
  annihilation be no longer made or maintained in our name.</p>
<p>THE THOR ROCKET BASES - are probably the most potent symbol of nuclear war
  preparations. A number of these sites have been completed in E.Anglia, the Midlands,
  Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. But built or not, we must not simply allow the public
  to accept the bases. We must continue to campaign vigorously against them and
  all they stand for.<br>
  <br>
  AND SO WE ARE ASKING YOU TO JOIN IN A RADICAL PROTEST</p>
<p>AT HARRINGTON (NEAR ROTHWELL) ON JANUARY 2nd<br>
  HARRINGTON ROCKET BASE - is one of a group of five Thor sites in the E. Midlands.
  The other bases in the group are at N. Luffenham (Rutland), Polebrook (near
  Peterborough), Great Dalby (near Melton Mowbray), and Folkingham (Near Sleaford,
  Lincs.).</p>
<p>WHY DEMONSTRATE AT HARRINGTON? - throughout the summer the Committee conducted
  an active campaign in the are, concentrating on Harrington. It therefore seems
  the most suitable site for a non-violent protest. It is well located for a national
  demonstration, being right in the centre of England. </p>
<p>ACTION ALREADY TAKEN IN THE AREA<br>
  For about two months during the past summer the Direct Action Committee, in
  conjunction with members of six local Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament groups,
  and supporters from all over the country, carried out an intensive campaign
  against the E.Midlands rocket sites.<br>
  The aim of the campaign was to arouse people in the region to oppose the missile
  sites, and to persuade workers on them to quit.<br>
  It was a varied campaign, which included leafleting and canvassing in the towns
  and villages, holding open-air meetings and poster-parades, and from time to
  time picketing the bases themselves.<br>
  In addition to asking the workers on the sites to leave their jobs, we called
  on local contractors with the same request, and collected signatures for a petition
  to the main contractors, Monk &amp; Co. of Warrington. The petition was presented
  to the General Manager by members of the Macclesfield Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament
  group.<br>
  We found out all we could about alternative work for builders in the area, and
  so were able to persuade one or two men who came to apply for jobs at Harrington
  to go off and look for other work. When canvassing, we asked sympathetic people
  to pledge sums of money to help any workers who decided to quit his job on conscientious
  grounds. We were able to write to 17 local people for money when eventually
  Herbert Ingall and Tom Godfrey threw up their jobs at the Polebrook site.<br>
  We made all the contacts we could with local Trade unionists - with the result
  that we were able to discuss the campaign with twenty Trade Union branches and
  Trades Councils, 50% of which passed resolutions in support of what we were
  doing. A number of Trade Unions were officially represented at the demonstration
  on the airfield at Polebrook rocket base, which was the culmination of the campaign.<br>
  Other demonstrations held during the summer were the week-long round-the-clock
  picket at Harrington, and a non-violent attempt, by a small mostly local team,
  to &quot;occupy&quot; the Great Dalby site by camping on it at a very early
  stage in its construction.<br>
  A core of sympathisers was located in the course of canvassing Corby New Town.
  They can form the basis of a Nuclear Disarmament Group there.</p>
<p>THE SORT OF DEMONSTRATION WE HAVE IN MIND<br>
  If you come to Harrington on January 2nd, we shall be asking you to run the
  risk of serious personal hardship. For we believe the situation we are in today
  calls for courage, resolution and a readiness on the part of many ordinary people
  to make personal sacrifices.<br>
  So we shall be asking you to demonstrate your opposition to all nuclear war
  preparations BY SITTING DOWN IN THE ENTRANCE TO THIS ROCKET SITE and remaining
  there when traffic tries to pass through the gates.<br>
  This action will mean running the risk of injury, or of arrest for refusing
  to move and so &quot;obstructing the police in the course of their duty.&quot;
  Volunteers would also be liable to charges under the Conspiracy or the Official
  Secrets Acts. As a result you might have to serve a term of imprisonment. If
  anyone asked you to get up and move out of the way you would have to refuse.
  If anyone tried to remove you bodily, or attacked you, you would offer NO RESISTANCE
  WHATEVER. <br>
  IT IS EXTREMELY LIKELY that the authorities will make every effort to avoid
  arresting anyone, in order to avoid publicity (as is suggested by the Police
  attitude during our summer campaigns). They may very well be prepared to remove
  demonstrators bodily from the site time and again, perhaps for days on end,
  rather than make any arrests.<br>
  AND IT IS EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT that a large number of people volunteer for
  the protest demonstration - more than went to Swaffham last year. And there
  must be a large core of people prepared to remain at the site solidly for a
  week, so that the demonstration does not dwindle and peter out.</p>
