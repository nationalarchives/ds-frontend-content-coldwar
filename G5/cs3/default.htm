      <p>By the 1950s both of the superpowers had enough firepower to devastate 
        the world many times over. As a result, many people shared the concerns 
        of anti nuclear campaigners and organisations such as the Campaign for 
        Nuclear Disarmament - CND. This organisation emerged in the 1960s from 
        a number of anti nuclear protest groups. Most of them shared the same 
        concerns: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The possibility of a nuclear accident</li>
        <li>The possibility of one side making a mistake and responding to a nuclear 
          attack by the other side which had not happened (there were numerous 
          close calls of this sort during the Cold War)</li>
        <li>The environmental damage being done by nuclear testing</li>
        <li>The view that nuclear weapons were immoral. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Almost all ordinary people and politicians agreed that these were important 
        concerns. However, there were major differences on what to do about these. 
        CND generally supported unilateral nuclear disarmament. Many members of 
        the Labour party, like future leader Michael Foot, believed in this policy. 
        The idea was simple - get rid of your nuclear weapons and then the Soviets 
        have no need for theirs. </p>
      <p>In Easter 1958 about a thousand CND members went on a protest march to 
        the British government's nuclear research base at Aldermaston in Berkshire. 
        For many years afterwards the Easter march became an annual event. At 
        its height in the 1960s, there were tens of thousands present. CND called 
        for Britain to voluntarily give up its own nuclear weapons and to refuse 
        to allow the USA to have bases with nuclear weapons on British soil. The 
        CND movement grew steadily and spread to Holland, West Germany and Sweden.</p>
