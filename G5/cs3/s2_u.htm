<ul>
  <li>The Direct Action Committee Against Nuclear War was the forerunner of CND.
  </li>
  <li>Its main aim was to raise the awareness of the public about nuclear weapons
    and their implications for ordinary people. </li>
  <li>Thor rockets were British intercontinental ballistic missiles. It is important
    to remember that as well as firing nuclear missiles, missile bases were targets
    for Soviet missiles. </li>
  <li>This particular leaflet was not going to the general public. It was aimed
    at organisations who favoured nuclear disarmament. The idea was to spread
    the word about the demonstration to people who might join in the protest.
