<p>Mr Khrushchev's Monstrous Bomb</p>
<p>The JIC are meeting tomorrow to see whether they can draw any firm conclusions
  about Mr Khrushchev's recent boast in Moscow that the Russians had a weapon
  which could destroy the world. </p>
<p>The experts' preliminary view is that Mr Khrushchev has not made a great new
  breakthrough in any technological field: that is to say he has not developed
  any new rocketry or form of explosion. We have known for some time that he has
  an enormous nuclear bomb; but the experts still do not believe that he has any
  method of getting it anywhere. It is possible that he may have some new biological
  weapon; but again, the experts do not believe that he has discovered any safe
  method of disseminating it. </p>
<p>Apparently Moscow press and radio are tending to play Mr Khrushchev's statement
  down. </p>
<p>We shall hope to know more tomorrow; in particular we hope to have the Americans'
  opinion. </p>
