<p>2 The Western position for the coming Disarmament talks is based on the United
  States Disarmament programme, presented by President Kennedy to the United Nations
  General Assembly in September, 1961. We played a considerable part ourselves
  in the drafting of this. The Russian position will be based, so far as we know,
  on their Disarmament Plan presented to the United Nations General Assembly in
  September, 1960, though they may still come forward with a new plan. The main
  differences between the two are</p>
<ol class="lroman"><li> The Russian provision for fixed time limits (four years for the whole process
  of disarmament)....</li>
<li> Russian insistence that 'foreign bases' should be evacuated in the first
  stage of their plan, and foreign troops withdrawn from Europe as a preliminary
  measure.</li>
<li> Russian provision that all nuclear delivery vehicles, without distinction
  between &quot;strategic&quot; and &quot;tactical&quot;, should be destroyed
  in the first stage,</li>
<li> United States provision for a 'cut off' of production of fissionable material
  for weapons purposes in the first stage (the Russians provide for a second stage
  cut off only).</li>
<li> Russian insistence (made clearer in subsequent memoranda than in their
  plan) that &quot;control&quot; or &quot;verification&quot; should apply only
  to the destruction of agreed quantities of weapons, and that there should be
  no check on the stocks remaining, or the new weapons produced, after destruction</li>
<li> United States insistence that the later stages of disarmament should be
  accompanied by the rapid development of effective international peace- keeping
  machinery, including an effective international peace-keeping force.</li></ol>
<p>3. The Russian proposals are quite unacceptable to us, principally because
  of their position on verification; their effort to restrict our deployment by
  demanding the evacuation of foreign bases and troops; and their proposal to
  abolish the nuclear deterrent completely at an early stage. In spite (or because)
  of this, their plan has considerable appeal to thoughtless or frightened people
  every- where &#133;</p>
<p>&#133; it is most likely that the opening stages of the Geneva Conference will
  witness an intense propaganda effort by the Russians to sell their existing
  plan, or something like it &#133; and to discredit the United States Disarmament
  Programme.</p>
<p>4 Whether the Geneva Conference is to degenerate into a propaganda battle,
  therefore, or, as is possible, to open the way ultimately to some limited positive
  steps, our own task should remain the same; </p>
<p>to show that the Russian plans are full of contradictions and designed to give
  themselves one-sided advantages, </p>
<p>to show that our own are by contrast sober, realistic and fair, and above all
  to show that ours provide at a very early stage for some important concrete
  measures of disarmament. </p>
