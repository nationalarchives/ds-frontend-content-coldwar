<ul>
  <li>This document was a draft version of the official announcement
    of Britain's nuclear tests in 1957. It was passed to various senior military
    and political figures to make sure that they were happy with what it said
    before it was given to the press. </li>
  <li>Even in 1957 there were some concerns about the amount
    of nuclear testing going on in the Pacific. </li>
  <li>It was known that nuclear contamination could cause genetic
    mutations in animals and even humans. This knowledge inspired the Japanese
    science fiction monster Godzilla. There were several US films which also took
    on this theme in the 1950s and 1960s. </li>
  <li>This document was accompanied by notes about what
    questions could be answered after the initial announcement.
  </li>
