  <li>This is a poster produced by the British government Ministry of Information
    in the 1960s. </li>
  <li>At the time, the Hydrogen or thermonuclear bomb was relatively new. The
    USA and USSR both tested H Bombs in the 1960s, so people were aware of its
    power and concerned by it. </li>
  <li>During WW2 the government organised Civil Defence measures to protect against
    air raids and make sure emergency food and medical care was available.</li>
  <li>During the 1950s and 1960s the government produced many Civil Defence films,
    cinema advertisements, TV programmes and leaflets. This is one example. </li>
