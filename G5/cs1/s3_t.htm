<p>The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister of Defence on POLARIS.</p>
<p>The Minister of Defence recalled that the United States Government had welcomed
  the assurance which had been given by the Prime Minister in the course of his
  meeting with President Eisenhower in March that the United Kingdom Government
  would be agreeable in principle to making the necessary arrangements for a United
  States tender and a dock for POLARIS submarines to be stationed in Scottish
  waters &#133; </p>
<p>POLARIS submarines would be virtually invulnerable, and the United States authorities
  regarded them as a very important part of the diversified deterrent force which
  they planned to build up. </p>
<p>The operational characteristics of these submarines, which would cruise submerged
  for two or three months, would pose complex communications and other problems,
  and careful organisation would be required to ensure the efficiency and reliability
  of their crews. </p>
<p>The United States Government would welcome our close association with the United
  States Navy in this development and they hoped that the United Kingdom Government
  would feel able to participate, if only on a limited scale, in their POLARIS
  submarine plans. </p>
<p>The use of facilities in Scottish waters would enhance the effectiveness of
  the POLARIS force by about 30 per cent<br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>He had explained to Mr Gates that the project raised important political and
  defence considerations. In order to justify it to public opinion ion this country
  it would have to be presented as a joint project. This could be achieved if
  the United States government were to give us an option to purchase or build
  our own Polaris submarines. <br>
