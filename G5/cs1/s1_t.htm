<p><span class="s_titles">EFFECTS OF THE EXPLOSION OF A THERMO-NUCLEARBOMB</span></p>
<p> The explosion of a hydrogen bomb releases energy in three forms - blast, heat
  and nuclear radiation. Their relative importance depends on the distance of
  the bomb from the surface at the moment of explosion. Broadly speaking, the
  effects of blast and heat are comparatively local in all cases, whereas those
  of radiation may be very widespread.</p>
<p><span class="s_numberheadings">2.</span> <i>Size of the Bomb</i> -There is
  no technical limitation to the yield of this weapon. The analysis which follows
  is related throughout to a 1O-megaton ' bomb (10M.T). The highest yield achieved
  in the United States experiments to date is 30M.T. The area affected-by a bomb
  of this yield would be about 45 per cent. greater than in the case we are considering.</p>
<p><span class="s_numberheadings">3.</span> <i>Blast and Heat</i> - Blast and
  heat are more intense from an air burst than from a ground burst. - In dull
  weather damage from the heat wave is somewhat less extensive than in clear air.
  The blast and heat resulting from the explosion of a 1O-M.T. bomb would cause
  destruction on about the following scale: </p>

<p><span class="s_numberheadings">4.</span> <i>Radiation</i> - The initial radiation
  occurring within a few seconds of detonation of a bomb, whether air burst or
  ground burst, is probably confined within a radius of three or four miles. The
  area thus affected is therefore in any case devastated by heat and blast.</p>
<p>The residual radiation occurring as an after-effect of the explosion varies
  very greatly in its effects, according to the point of burst. If the bomb bursts
  too high for the fire ball to reach ground level, the bulk of the radio-active
  materials are carried into suspension in the upper atmosphere. They are then
  so dispersed that they have no serious local effects when they eventually settle
  out.</p>
<p>But if the bomb bursts at or near the ground, quantities of much heavier radio-active
  particles are carried for a while by the winds that blow in differing directions
  at different levels. The pattern of precipitation is irregular, varying with
  the speed and direction of the air currents in the area, but a high proportion
  of the fall-out occurs from very high levels where the winds are more constant
  in direction and speed. This tends to elongate the area of contamination in
  the direction of the winds there prevailing.</p>
<p><span class="s_numberheadings">5.</span> <i>Effects of Radiation on Life</i>.-
  No medical means of curing or even curbing the effects of radiation on human
  beings are yet known. On human beings the effects are cumulative over a considerable
  period, becoming lethal when a certain dosage has been absorbed. In the Marshall
  Islands natives on an atoll 110 miles from the explosion received about one-third
  of the lethal dose: Americans who remained in huts 150 miles downwind received
  over a tenth of the lethal dose. Both these groups were 20 miles off the main
  line of fall-out.</p>
<p>Symptoms of radiation sickness may not show for some days, or even weeks. But
  about one-fifth of the lethal dose produces temporary sickness, with increasing
  disability as absorption increases beyond this point.</p>
<p>On animals the direct effects are similar. (In the Marshall Islands all animal
  life was extinguished on an atoll 110 miles from the explosion.) <br>
