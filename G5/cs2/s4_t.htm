</p>
Good Evening, My Fellow Citizens:
<p>This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the
  Soviet military build up on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable
  evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is
  now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can
  be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western
  Hemisphere. </p>
<p>The characteristics of these new missile sites indicate two distinct types
  of installations. Several of them include medium range ballistic missiles, capable
  of carrying a nuclear warhead for a distance of more than 1,000 nautical miles.
  Each of these missiles, in short, is capable of striking Washington, D.C., the
  Panama Canal, Cape Canaveral, Mexico City, or any other city in the southeastern
  part of the United States, in Central America or in the Caribbean area. </p>
<p>Additional sites not yet completed appear to be designed for intermediate range
  ballistic missiles -- capable of travelling more than twice as far -- and thus
  capable of striking most of the major cities in the Western Hemisphere, ranging
  as far north as Hudson Bay, Canada, and as far south as Lima, Peru. In addition,
  jet bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons are now being uncrated and assembled
  in Cuba while the necessary air bases are being prepared. <br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>Acting, therefore, in the defence of our own security and of the entire Western
  Hemisphere, and under the authority entrusted to me by the Constitution as endorsed
  by the resolution of the Congress, I have directed that the following initial
  steps be taken immediately: </p>
<p>First: To halt this offensive build-up, a strict quarantine on all offensive
  military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any
  kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation and port will, if found to contain
  cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back <br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>Second: I have directed the continued and increased close surveillance of Cuba
  and its military build-up. &#133; I have directed the Armed Forces to prepare
  for any eventualities; and I trust that in the interest of both the Cuban people
  and the Soviet technicians at the sites, the hazards to all concerned of continuing
  the threat will be recognized. </p>
<p>Third: It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile
  launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack
  on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet
  Union. </p>
<p>Fourth: As a necessary military precaution, I have reinforced our base at Guantanamo,
  evacuated today the dependents of our personnel there, and ordered additional
  military units to be on a standby alert status. </p>
<p>Fifth: We are calling tonight for an immediate meeting of the Organ of Consultation
  under the Organization of American States, to consider this threat to hemispheric
  security<br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>Sixth: Under the Charter of the United Nations, we are asking tonight that
  an emergency meeting of the Security Council be convoked without delay to take
  action against this latest Soviet threat to world peace. Our resolution will
  call for the prompt dismantling and withdrawal of all offensive weapons in Cuba,
  under the supervision of U.N. observers, before the quarantine can be lifted.
</p>
<p>Seventh and finally: I call upon Chairman Khrushchev to halt and eliminate
  this clandestine, reckless, and provocative threat to world peace and to stable
  relations between our two nations. I call upon him further to abandon this course
  of world domination, and to join in an historic effort to end the perilous arms
  race and to transform the history of man. <br>
  ... </p>
<p>My fellow citizens: let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous
  effort on which we have set out. No one can foresee precisely what course it
  will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred. Many months in which
  both our patience and our will will be tested -- months in which many threats
  and denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers. But the greatest danger
  of all would be to do nothing. ... </p>
<p>Our goal is not the victory of might, but the vindication of right -- not peace
  at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom, here in this hemisphere,
  and we hope, around the world. God willing, that goal will be achieved. </p>
<p>Thank you and good night. </p>
