Surface to Surface Missile Launch sites
<p>3 IRBM</p>
<ol class="lalpha"><li> US Position: There are two launch areas located about 25nm west of Havana,
  each of four pads, under construction, which might be ready for operational
  use by early December 1962. </li>
<li> Comment If these are IRBM they will have a range of 2200 nm, extending from
  Hudson Bay through California to Lima, and be capable of striking a selection
  of targets in the USA. We are satisfied that these two launch areas represent
  surface to surface missile sites capable of launching missiles with nuclear
  warheads. On the basis of the evidence available we cannot positively identify
  the sites as being associated with the 2200nm missile. </li></ol>
