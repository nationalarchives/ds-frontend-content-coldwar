The Prime Minister said &#133; In retrospect it was evident that the President
had played his hand with great skill &#133; President Kennedy had steered a difficult
course between being driven into a premature use of force and appearing to waver
in his determination. While reluctant to authorise an invasion of Cuba, he had
shown great firmness in continuing to make preparations for it.
<p>The Foreign Secretary said that if the United States had attacked Cuba there
  could be little doubt that the Soviet Government would have reacted in Berlin.
  There would then have been a real and immediate risk of nuclear war. In the
  public presentation of recent events it would be important to avoid engendering
  over optimism &#133; </p>
<p>A particular danger here was that the sense of relief engendered by the solution
  of the Cuban Crisis might lead to demands for the elimination of nuclear weapons
  as the first stage of any disarmament plan. The West could not accept this,
  since it would leave a clear field to the massive conventional superiority of
  the Communist powers: at all stages of any disarmament plan nuclear and conventional
  disarmament would have to be considered together. An agreement on missile bases
  would also present difficulty, since all the Russian bases of any importance
  were on their own soil. In short it would be necessary to point out realistically
  that the chances of international agreement on major issues had not been improved,
  but might have become worse because the West had more reason to be suspicious
  of Communist professions of good faith. </p>
