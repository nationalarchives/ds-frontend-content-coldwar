      <p><b>Background</b><br>
        Cuba is an island in the Caribbean Sea, just south of the US state of 
        Florida. Until the late 1950s it was dominated by the USA. There was a 
        huge US naval base at Guantanamo. Rich Americans often came on holiday 
        to enjoy the beaches and spend money in the bars and casinos of the capital, 
        Havana. American business owned the major industries - sugar and tobacco. 
      </p>
      <p>In the midst of the wealth there was terrible poverty. There was also 
        corrupt government. Cuba was ruled by a dictator called Batista. In 1958 
        he was overthrown by a young Communist revolutionary called Fidel Castro. 
        Castro had a lot of support among the Cuban people. He took control of 
        the US owned industries. He resisted attempts by the American secret service, 
        the CIA, to overthrow him. The most spectacular was at the Bay of Pigs 
        in 1961. Castro's forces defeated a force of Cubans backed by President 
        Kennedy who wanted to overthrow Castro. The Bay of Pigs was a major humiliation 
        for the USA. </p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, any enemy of the USA was seen by Soviet leader Khrushchev 
        as a friend of the USSR. It was a time of great tension in superpower 
        relations. In May 1960 the USSR shot down an American U2 spy plane flying 
        illegally over the USSR. In August 1961 Khrushchev and Kennedy had clashed 
        over the building of the Berlin Wall. Throughout the late 1950s and early 
        1960s the two sides had tried to reach agreements on limiting the spread 
        of nuclear weapons but neither side had much confidence in the good faith 
        of the other. </p>
      <p>It was especially enjoyable for Khrushchev to have an ally in America's 
        'back yard'. Khrushchev saw this as a similar situation to the presence 
        of the Western powers in Berlin. The USSR was soon giving Cuba economic 
        aid, technical support and military 'advisers' from the USSR. As the USA 
        became more aggressive to Cuba, the USSR provided more support. </p>

        T<b>he Crisis</b><br>
        In October 1962 an American U2 spy plane revealed just how much Russian 
        support Cuba had. Its photographs showed missile bases and launchers on 
        Cuba (and missiles, of course). It was soon clear that Soviet ships were 
        on their way to Cuba carrying more nuclear missiles to be set up in Cuba. 
      </p>
      <p>The world was about to enter its most serious Cold War confrontation 
        so far. Kennedy set up a special committee called Excomm to advise him. 
        Some advisers wanted to attack the missile sites and even invade Cuba. 
        Others advised a careful diplomatic approach. </p>
      <p>In the end Kennedy opted to use a naval blockade of Cuba, cutting off 
        military supplies to the island. This was still dangerous. It was likely 
        to involve stopping Soviet ships, and nobody knew how Khrushchev would 
        react. The tension reached its highest point on October 27th, when US 
        and Soviet ships seemed sure to clash. A Third World War looked very likely 
        indeed. However, Soviet leader Khrushchev then sent two letters to Kennedy 
        offering a suggested compromise. </p>
      <p>Kennedy was just as eager as Khrushchev to get out of this terrible situation. 
        Khrushchev agreed to pull the missiles out of Cuba. Kennedy agreed to 
        end the blockade of Cuba. He also promised not to invade Cuba - this meant 
        he had to agree to accept a Communist state as his neighbour. Recent evidence 
        suggests that there was also an understanding that some US missiles in 
        Turkey and Europe would be removed. This was not announced at the time. 
      </p>
      <p><b>The aftermath<br>
        </b> Both sides claimed credit for avoiding a nuclear war over Cuba. They 
        also realised how close they had come to a nuclear war. In the years that 
        followed Cuba the superpowers did make greater efforts in nuclear disarmament. 
        They also set up the direct 'Hot Line' between Washington and Moscow. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Your Task</b><br>
        In this case study you are going to look at sources which cover all of 
        these issues, but will focus on these broad areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The reasons why Cuba became the centre of a Cold War crisis</li>
        <li>How serious the crisis was</li>
        <li>The consequences of the Cuban Crisis. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>At the end of the case study you will have to decide what you will write 
        in your soundtrack for the presentation. </p>
