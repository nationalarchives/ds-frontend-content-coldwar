Comrade Deputies, everyone remembers the tense days of October when mankind was
anxiously listening to the news coming from the Caribbean. In those days the world
was poised on the brink of a thermonuclear catastrophe. What created this crisis?
How did it develop? What lessons must be learned from it?<br>
&#133;
<p>Having raised the banner of the people's anti imperialist revolution, the freedom
  loving Cuban people rallied behind their leader, Fidel Castro, and his comrades
  in arms, and by 1959 had cleared their land of the North American brigands and
  their accomplices &#133;</p>
<p>Relations of sincere friendship based on equality, respect for sovereignty
  and economic co-operation were established between the Soviet Union and Cuba
  from the very first few days of her new life &#133;</p>
<p>Flouting generally accepted standards of international relations, the reactionary
  forces of the USA, from the first day of the victory of the Cuban revolution,
  have done everything to overthrow Cuba's Revolutionary Government and restore
  their domination there. </p>
<p>Seeking to justify its aggressive actions, American reaction is repeating that
  the crisis in the Caribbean was allegedly created by Cuba herself, adding that
  blame rests also with the Soviet Union, which shipped there rockets and IL-28
  bombers. But is this so? It is true that we sent arms there at the request of
  the Cuban Government. But what motives guided us in so doing? Exclusively humanitarian
  motives. Cuba needed weapons as a means of deterring aggressors, and not as
  a means of attack. For Cuba was under a real threat of invasion. <br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>Some people pretend that the rockets were supplied by us for an attack on the
  USA. This, of course, is not sensible reasoning. Why should we station rockets
  in Cuba for this purpose when we were and are able to strike from our own territory,
  possessing as we do the necessary number of intercontinental missiles of the
  required range and power? <br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>By 20th October a large scale build up of US and naval air forces, paratroops
  and marines had begun in the South of the USA, at the approaches to Cuba &#133;
  On 22nd October the Kennedy Administration announced a quarantine of Cuba. The
  word 'quarantine' by the way, was merely a fig leaf in this case. Actually it
  was a blockade, piracy on the high seas. </p>
<p>Events developed rapidly. The US Command alerted all its armed forces &#133;
  The forces of the USA's NATO allies were also put on the alert &#133; As a result
  of these aggressive steps by the US Government there arose a threat of thermonuclear
  war. </p>
<p>In the face of these intensified military reparations we, for our part, had
  to take appropriate measures. The Soviet Government instructed the USSR Minister
  of Defence to alert the entire army of the Soviet Union , and above all the
  Soviet intercontinental and strategic rocket forces &#133; </p>
<p>In these conditions, if one or the other side had not shown restraint and had
  not done everything possible to avert the outbreak of war, an explosion with
  irreparable consequences would have followed. <br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>Which side triumphed? Who won? In this respect one may say it was sanity, the
  cause of security and peoples, that won. The two sides displayed a sober approach
  and took into account the fact that unless steps were taken that could help
  to overcome the dangerous development of events, a third world war might break
  out. </p>
<p>As a result of mutual concessions and compromise, an understanding was reached
  which made it possible to remove the dangerous tension, to normalise the situation.
  Both sides made concessions. We withdrew the ballistic rockets and agreed to
  withdraw the IL-28 aircraft. This gives satisfaction to the Americans. But both
  Cuba and the Soviet Union received satisfaction too: the American invasion of
  Cuba has been averted; the naval blockade has been lifted; the situation in
  the Caribbean area is returning to normal; people's Cuba exists, is gaining
  strength and is developing under the leadership of its Revolutionary Government,
  its dauntless leader, Fidel Castro. <br>
