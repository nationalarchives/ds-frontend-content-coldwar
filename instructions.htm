<ul>
  <li class="popup_body">There are 6 galleries in this Exhibition, each containing
    a number of case studies. Each Case Study is designed so that it can be used
    as a 'stand alone' item in one or two classroom sessions. However, each Case
    Study in a Gallery is linked to form a more coherent area of research. This
    has been done to give students and teachers the maximum amount of flexibility.</li>
  <li class="popup_body"> The Case Studies in each Gallery are linked together
    to allow students to answer the 'Big Question'. Details of the Big Question
    can be found on the Introduction to the Gallery Page and on each source page.</li>
  <li class="popup_body">Each Gallery is accompanied by a timeline and a glossary
    to assist students and teachers in putting the source material into context.
  </li>
  <li class="popup_body">Each source is accompanied, where appropriate, by useful
    notes and a transcript. The latter is intended to cover the sections of the
    source needed to answer the question and may, therefore, be shorter than the
    source itself.</li>
  <li class="popup_body">Some of the sources are video clips. To access these,
    you will need <a href="http://www.real.com/" target="_blank" title="External website - link opens in new window">RealPlayer.</a> </li>
  <li class="popup_body">A Word option has been included on all source pages.
    This will allow students to type their answers to the questions and then either
    Save or Print their work</li>
  <li class="popup_body">Each Case Study is accompanied by a Worksheet, which
    can saved or printed by the student. The Case Study Worksheet is designed
    to help students gather information from the Case Studies so that they can
    answer the Big Question.</li>
  <li class="popup_body"> At various points throughout the Exhibition, there are
    links to other websites where extra information or other resources can be
    found. Please note that the PRO is not responsible for the content of any
    external website.</li>
  <li class="popup_body">The Archive section contains extended versions of the 
    National Archives sources used in the Case Studies. These can be used as extra 
    information or as stand-alone resources.</li>
  <li class="popup_body">Image sizes are ca. 70k. In certain cases, an image might
    be larger, and will need a longer download time.</li>
