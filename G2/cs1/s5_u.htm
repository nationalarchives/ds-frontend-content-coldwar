  <li>This poster is one of thousands produced by the British government's
    Ministry of Information in the Second World War. It is designed to be reproduced
    in other posters or publications. This probably explains why it is relatively
    simple and uses clear black and white images. <br>
    </li>
  <li>The largest campaign of the Second World War was the
    conflict between the USSR and German forces. It was the decisive campaign
    of the war. <br>
  </li>
  <li>British Empire and US forces were not in a position to
    attack the strongly defended French coast until June 1944. However, they did
    fight German forces in North Africa and Italy. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Another key element of the campaign was the bombing of
    German towns, cities and industries. Historians now know this had a devastating
    impact on Germany's war economy. It also drew away German aircraft and equipment
    which would have been used to fight the USSR. <br>
  </li>
  <li>As well as being a port, Stettin was also the site of
    a major chemical works which produced artificial fuel oil from coal. </li>
