<p>See with<br>
  Soviet Monitor no 3943 Dec. 7<br>
  Soviet Monitor no 3941 Dec. 6<br>
  3944</p>
<p>See, especially, marked passages from &quot;Izvestiza&quot; and &quot;Pravda&quot;
  articles.</p>
<p>&quot;Pravda&quot; says that the Conference was a logical development of the
  closest friendship and collaboration between the US, UK and USSR, forged during
  the war.</p>
<p>&quot;Izvestiza&quot; says that anyone who reads the Declaration will realise
  that the outcome of the war has been decided beyond doubt.</p>
<p>&quot;Red Star&quot; says that the Declaration proves the complete failure
  of Hitler's strategy.</p>
<p>Mass meetings of all sections of the Soviet population have been held to acclaim
  the Declaration.</p>
<p>Now see N7298, N7382 and N7333</p>
<p>The Soviet reactions to the Tehran Conference are marked by a warmth and interest
  which are quite new and it is being celebrated in leading articles and at factory
  meetings in a way which has hitherto been reserved for major events on the home
  front. The Soviet people are thus getting an education in international affairs
  such as they have never had before and which is bound to leave a fairly deep
  mark. Everything now depends on the military business being carried out fully
  and on time. If they are, we may hope that all will be well. If they are not,
  the reaction will be even stronger than the present enthusiasm.</p>
