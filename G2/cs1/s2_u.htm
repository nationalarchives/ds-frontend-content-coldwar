<ul>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Ministry of Information 
      was part of Britain's civil service. Its job was to provide the public with 
      information in a way that would be effective and easy to remember.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the war, this 
      department had to provide information about issues like rationing, air raids 
      etc. However, it also produced material to boost morale or make people hate 
      the enemy. In other words, it produced propaganda. <br>
      </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This poster comes from 
      late 1941. Up to that point, Britain had been fighting very much alone against 
      Germany, Italy and Japan. In June 1941 Hitler attacked the USSR. This meant 
      that Britain now had a large and powerful ally. <br>
      </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fact that Britain 
      and the USSR had disagreed over many issues in the past was quickly forgotten. 
      Both sides were opposed to Nazi Germany. <br>
      </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The caption in this 
      poster reads 'Greetings to the heroic warrior of the Soviet Union from British 
      allies fighting with him.'<br>
      </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Britain and the USSR 
      co-operated in many different ways. RAF pilots flew bombing missions over 
      Germany and landed and re-fuelled in Soviet airfields. They also trained 
      Soviet pilots to fly British aircraft. <br>
      </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Merchant seamen and 
      Royal Navy ships brought supplies to the USSR along the dangerous convoy 
      routes to the North of Norway. <br>
      </font></li>
    <li class="s_body"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
      commanding officers of both armies regularly met to discuss tactics and 
      ways in which they could work together. <br>
      </font> </li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, it should 
      be remembered that the largest scale fighting of the Second World War took 
      place between the USSR and German forces. This conflict dwarfed all others.<br>
      </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font> </li>
