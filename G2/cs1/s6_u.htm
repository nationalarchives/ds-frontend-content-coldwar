<ul>
  <li>This poster is one of thousands produced by the British government's
    Ministry of Information in the Second World War. It is designed to be reproduced
    in other posters or publications. This probably explains why it is relatively
    simple and uses clear black and white images. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The largest campaign of the Second World War was the
    conflict between the USSR and German forces. It was the decisive campaign
    of the war. <br>
  </li>
  <li>British Empire and US forces were not in a position to
    attack the strongly defended French coast until June 1944, so they could not
    mount an attack to help the Red Army. <br>
  </li>
  <li>One way they did help was by sending war supplies to
    the USSR. Most of the supplies went on the Arctic convoys around the north
    of Norway. This was only possible at certain times of year because the sea
    froze. It was extremely dangerous because of enemy actions and because of
    the terrible weather conditions. <br>
  </li>
  <li>These and other convoy routes (from the USA) provided
    the USSR with over 500,000 motor vehicles and 1,900 locomotives, as well as
    half of its copper and rubber tyres.<br>
    </li>
