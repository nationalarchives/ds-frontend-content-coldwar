<ul>
    <li>Throughout the war the Foreign Office had officials stationed in its embassies 
      all around the world whose job was to study the media in their particular 
      country. They did this for both the USSR and the USA. This particular extract 
      is a handwritten note which went on the front cover of one of these reports. 
      <br>
  </li>
  <li>The main report detailed how the Soviet media reacted to
    the Teheran Conference. This was the first conference between the leaders
    of all three major wartime allies (Britain, the USA, the USSR). <br>
  </li>
  <li>There had been other meetings to prepare for this Conference.
    Churchill had met Stalin in Moscow earlier in 1943. The Foreign Ministers
    of all 3 countries had met shortly before the Teheran conference. <br>
  </li>
  <li>At the end of the Teheran conference all three leaders signed
    up to a Declaration. They promised to work together to defeat the Germans
    and Japanese. They set out their plans for the world after the war ended.
    They also promised to remain friends. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Pravda, Izvestia and Red Star are all titles of Soviet newspapers.
    <br>
