<ul>
  <li>American presidents usually had a fairly free hand when
    it came to carrying out foreign affairs. However, if they signed up to any
    agreements they had to get approval from the US Congress. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Truman's speech gave a detailed account of all the issues
    covered at Potsdam. This extract focuses on the discussions over German payment
    of reparations. <br>
  </li>
  <li>As the war ended there was still a lot of Germany industry
    which was in good working order but was geared to war. Much of the machinery
    could be converted to other uses not connected with war. This is what Stalin
    wanted to take in reparations.<br>
  </li>
  <li>This was a deeply controversial issue, partly because
    Truman did not want to repeat the same mistakes that were made in the Treaty
    of Versailles after the First World War. In that settlement Germany had to
    pay reparations, and had to borrow money from the USA to do this. This caused
    instability which helped Hitler and the Nazis to take power in Germany. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Truman feared making Germany bitter and resentful.
    However, he probably did not realise how badly damaged the USSR was by the
    war with Germany. Stalin was determined to gain compensation from Germany
    but at the same time he did not want Truman to see how badly damaged the USSR
    was.
