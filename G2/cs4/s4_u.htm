  <li>American presidents usually had a fairly free hand when it came to carrying
    out foreign affairs. However, if they signed up to any agreements they had
    to get approval from the US Congress. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Truman's speech gave a detailed account of all the issues covered at Potsdam.
    This extract focuses on Truman's decisions about America's use of the atomic
    bomb. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Truman made the speech on August 10th 1945. The USA dropped atomic bombs
    on Japan on August 6th (Hiroshima) and 9th (Nagasaki) 1945.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Truman told Stalin about the bomb at the Potsdam Conference. Truman thought
    that Stalin did not understand what he was talking about. Stalin thought that
    Truman was trying to intimidate him. </li>
