<ul>
  <li>The Potsdam Conference lasted from July 17th to August
    2nd 1945. <br>
  </li>
  <li>At the time of the conference Germany was defeated and
    Japan was losing the war. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Much of Europe and Asia had been devastated by war. <br>
  </li>
  <li>There was a strong feeling that the Big Three and the
    new United Nations Organisation would have to repair physical things like
    buildings, businesses etc AND rebuild non-physical things like trust, respect
    and decent behaviour. <br>
  </li>
  <li>People in Britain, the USA and USSR had high hopes
    for the Potsdam Conference. They were looking forward to a better world once
    the war was over and they hoped their leaders would deliver it.
