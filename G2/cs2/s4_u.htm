<ul>
  <li>In September 1939 Germany invaded Poland and so did the USSR. These two
    states divided Poland between them. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Many Poles escaped from Poland and found their way to Britain where they
    served in the armed forces. Leading Poles also set up a Polish Government
    in Exile in London. <br>
  </li>
  <li>In 1941 Hitler attacked the USSR and conquered the rest of Poland and much
    Soviet territory. By 1944 the Soviets were retaking their own lands and moving
    into Poland on their way to Germany. <br>
  </li>
  <li>This raised the question of what would happen to Poland. The key issues
    concerned where Poland's borders would be, and how Poland would be run. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Polish Government in Exile were very suspicious of the USSR. They were
    reluctant to agree any terms with Stalin. They also felt that Stalin would
    not keep his word even if he did give promises to Poland. </li>
</ul>
