<p>THE FOREIGN SECRETARY reported that he had now received a further communication
  from the Polish Government. This was under examination, and [the Foreign Secretary]
  sought clarification or guarantees on a number of important and difficult points.
</p>
<p>The following points were made in the course of the discussion which followed:</p>
<p>(a) Did the Russians really want an independent Poland? Or had they in view
  a puppet Government under Russian control and a Soviet Republic? The Foreign
  Secretary said there were increasing signs which pointed in the latter direction
  (in other words, he thought they wanted to make Poland a Soviet Republic under
  their influence). <br>
  &#133; </p>
<p>(c) If no settlement were now reached between Russia and Poland, and the present
  Polish Government were in consequence to break up, the result would be a certain
  strain, or even some degree of estrangement, between Russia and the Western
  Powers. This would be calamitous, and might carry in it the seeds of future
  wars. It was therefore incumbent upon us (it was our responsibility) to make
  every endeavour to secure an arrangement if possible. Further, there was no
  ground for holding that Russia would not in fact adhere to an arrangement reached,
  or that she took a light view of treaty obligations. And she had much to gain
  by maintaining the good relations established at the Moscow and Teheran Conferences.
  Generally we had reason to believe that Russia wanted to co-operate with the
  United States, and with this country. <br>
