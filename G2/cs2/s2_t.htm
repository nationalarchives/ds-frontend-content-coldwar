<p>In conversation recently with a member of this department, Soviet Ambassador
  referred to suspicions harboured by his countrymen that this country was not
  pulling its weight and devoting its full energies to the war against Germany.
  The ambassador said that, while he and others who knew this country realised
  that such suspicions were not altogether justified, there were a number of highly
  placed persons in the USSR, though perhaps not the highest placed, who were
  convinced that these suspicions were well founded (the conviction was particularly
  strong in the army), and who were able to prevent the true picture being presented
  to the Soviet people. </p>
<p>If you see no objection, I would be grateful if you would consider taking the
  opportunity offered by an interview with Stalin to say that on your visit here
  you were profoundly amazed that the Soviet Government were so misinformed about
  certain aspects of this country. As examples you could give the 'Pravda's' treatment
  of the Hess incident and references that have been allowed to appear in the
  Soviet press about the continued existence in this country of influential persons
  favouring appeasement, with the implication that we are not wholly behind the
  war effort. </p>
