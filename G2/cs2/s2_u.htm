<ul>
  <li>One issue which was constantly discussed between the wartime allies was
    the 'Second Front'. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Throughout the war Stalin called for Britain and the USA to open a Second
    Front against Germany. What he meant was the Western powers should attack
    areas such as the Balkans, Italy or France. This would draw off large German
    forces which for most of the war were focused on the USSR. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The land battle between Germany and the USSR was by far the largest campaign
    of the war. <br>
  </li>
  <li>However, many Soviets were not aware of US and British actions in North
    Africa, as well as the enormous supplies sent to the USSR and also the impact
    of the bombing campaign against Germany. <br>
  </li>
  <li>This document is a telegram from the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden to the
    British ambassador in Moscow. It is one of a series in which the British embassy
    in Moscow and Eden exchanged views regarding feelings in the USSR on the issue
    of the Second Front. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Hess incident refers to an event in May 1941 when the very senior Nazi,
    Rudolf Hess, flew to Scotland. He put forward plans for peace between Britain
    and Germany and even an alliance against the USSR. He was arrested and the
    offer was totally rejected. However, the event seemed suspicious to some Soviet
    observers who remembered the Munich Agreement of 1938. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Pravda was a Soviet newspaper. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Even in 1940 some politicians in Britain favoured appeasement - a deal with
    Germany. By the time of this telegram this was not an issue.</li>
