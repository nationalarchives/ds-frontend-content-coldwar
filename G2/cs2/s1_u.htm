<ul>
  <li>At the time of this meeting, Britain had been
    sending supply convoys to the USSR for about a year. They sailed once a month,
    during the periods of the year when the weather was good enough and the Russian
    ports were not frozen up. <br>
    </li>
  <li>The war between the USSR and Germany was fought
    over vast areas of open countryside. In this kind of warfare tanks and aircraft
    were absolutely vital weapons. <br>
    </li>
  <li>German tanks were extremely well armoured. Only
    powerful guns could destroy them. <br>
    </li>
  <li>Hurricanes were British fighter aircraft.<br>
    </li>
  <li>In late 1942 British Empire and US forces were
    engaged in major campaigns in the Middle East and North Africa. Desert conditions
    also required tanks and aircraft. <br>
