<p align="center">OPERATION UNTHINKABLE </p>
<p align="center">REPORT BY THE JOINT PLANNING STAFF</p>
<ol><li> We have examined Operation Unthinkable.
  As instructed, we have taken the following assumptions on which to base our
  examination:
<ol class="lalpha"><li> The undertaking has the full
  support of public opinion in the British empire and the United States...</li>
  <li> Great Britain and the United States have full assistance from the Polish armed
  forces and can count upon the use of German manpower and what remains of German
  industrial capacity... </li></ol>
  </li>
<p>Owing to the special need for
  secrecy, the normal staff in Service Ministries have not been consulted. </p>
<p>OBJECT </p>
<li> The overall or political object is to impose upon Russia
  the will of the United States and British Empire. </p>
<p>Even though 'the will' of these two countries may be defined
  as no more than a square deal for Poland, that does not necessarily limit the
  military commitment. A quick success might induce the Russians to submit to
  our will at least for the time being; but it might not. That is for the Russians
  to decide. If they want total war, they are in a position to have it.</li>
<li> The only way we can achieve
  our object with certainty and lasting results is by victory in a total war but
  in view of what we have said in paragraph 2 above, on the possibility of quick
  success, we have thought it right to consider the problem on two hypotheses:
  </p>
<ol class="lalpha"><li> That a total war is necessary,
  and on this hypothesis we have examined our chances of success. </li>
<li> That the political appreciation
  is that a quick success would suffice to gain our political object and that
  the continuing commitment need not concern us. </li></ol>
  </li>
<p>TOTAL WAR </p>
<li> Apart from the chances of revolution
  in the USSR and the political collapse of the present regime - on which we are
  not competent to express an opinion - the elimination of Russia could only be
  achieved as a result of:</p>
<ol class="lalpha"><li> the occupation of such areas
  of metropolitan Russia that the war making capacity of the country would be
  reduced to a point at which further resistance became impossible. </li>
<li> Such a decisive defeat of the Russian forces in the field
  as to render it impossible for the USSR to continue the war.</li>
</li>
</ol>
