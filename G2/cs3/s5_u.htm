<ul>
    <li>At the time of this telegram German forces were defeated. The American 
      and British forces are scaling down their armies in Europe and transferring 
      forces to fight against Japan. <br>
  </li>
  <li>As Churchill wrote, Soviet forces controlled most of Eastern Europe. A number
    of disagreements arose about what was to happen in the Eastern European countries
    once Germany was defeated. Vienna was one of many cities which the Americans
    and Britain did not want to occupy but the USSR did. <br>
  </li>
    <li>In many Eastern European countries Communists had played an important 
      role in resisting the Nazis (although many non- Communists also resisted 
      the Nazis as well). Many communists used their support from the war and 
      support from the Red army to take control of the government of countries 
      where the USSR drove German forces out. This is what Churchill meant by 
      the Communist technique. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The USA, Britain and USSR reached a number of agreements at a conference
    at Yalta in February 1945. You can read more about this in the section on
    Yalta. </li>
