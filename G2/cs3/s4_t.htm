<p>One outstanding example of joint action by the three major Allied powers was
  the solution reached on Poland. The whole Polish question was a potential source
  of trouble in post-war Europe, and we came to the conference determined to find
  a common ground for its solution. We did. We know everybody does not agree with
  it - obviously. </p>
<p>Our objective was to help create a strong, independent, and prosperous nation
  - that is the thing we must all remember - those words agreed to by Russia,
  by Britain, and by me: the objective of making Poland a strong, independent,
  and prosperous nation with a government ultimately to be selected by the Polish
  people themselves. </p>
<p>To achieve this objective, it was necessary to provide for the formation of
  a new government much more representative than had been possible while Poland
  was enslaved. There are, you know, two governments; one in London, one in Lublin,
  practically in Russia. </p>
<p>Accordingly, steps were taken at Yalta, to reorganise the existing provisional
  government in Poland on a broader democratic basis, so as to include democratic
  leaders now in Poland and those abroad. This new, reorganised government will
  be recognised by all of us as the temporary government of Poland. Poland needs
  a temporary government in the worst way - an interim government is another way
  to put it. However, the new Polish provisional government of national unity
  will be pledged to holding a free election as soon as possible on the basis
  of universal suffrage and a secret ballot. </p>
<p>Throughout history, Poland has been the corridor through which attacks on Russia
  have been made. Twice in this generation, Germany has struck at Russia through
  this corridor. To insure European security and world peace, a strong and independent
  Poland is necessary to prevent that from happening again. </p>
<p>The decisions with respect to the boundaries of Poland were frankly a compromise,
  I did not agree with all of them by any means. But we did not go as far as Britain
  wanted in certain areas; we did not go as far as Russia wanted in certain areas;
  and we did not go as far as I wanted in certain areas. It was a compromise.
