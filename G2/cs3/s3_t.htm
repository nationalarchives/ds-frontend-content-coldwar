<p>When we met at Yalta, in addition to laying out strategic and tactical plans
  for the complete and final military victory over Germany, there were other problems
  of vital political consequence.</p>
<p>&#133; </p>
<p>[Roosevelt then listed the problems as:<br>
  1 What to do with Germany<br>
  2 The UNO<br>
  3 The countries liberated from the Nazis<br>
  4 Poland and Yugoslavia]</p>
<p>&#133;</p>
<p>Days were spent in discussing these momentous matters, and we argued freely
  and frankly across the table. But at the end on every point unanimous agreement
  was reached. And more important even than the agreement of words, I may say
  that we achieved a unity of thought and a way of getting along together. We
  know, of course, that it was Hitler's hope and the German war lords' hope that
  we would not agree - that some slight crack might appear in the solid wall of
  allied unity, a crack that would give him and his fellow gangsters one last
  hope of escaping their just doom. That is the objective for which his propaganda
  machine has been working for many months. But Hitler has failed. </p>
<p>Never before have the major allies been more closely united- not only in their
  war aims but also in their peace aims. And they are determined to continue to
  be united, to be united with each other - and with all peace-loving nations
  - so that the ideal of lasting peace will become a reality. <br>
