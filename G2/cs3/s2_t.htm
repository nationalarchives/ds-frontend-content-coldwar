  <a href="#DLE">II. DECLARATION OF LIBERATED EUROPE</a><br>
  <a href="#REP">V. REPARATIONS</a></p>
<p><br>
  <a name="WO"></a>I. WORLD ORGANIZATION<br>
  It was decided:<br>
  <ol><li> That a United Nations conference on the proposed World Organization should
  be summoned for Wednesday, 25 April, 1945, and should be held in the United
  States of America.</li>
  <li> The nations to be invited to this conference should be:<br>
  <ol class="lalpha"><li> the United Nations as they existed on 8 Feb., 1945; and<br>
  </li>
  <li> Such of the Associated Nations as have declared war on the common enemy
  by 1 March, 1945. When the conference on World Organization is held, the delegates
  of the United Kingdom and United States of America will support a proposal to
  admit to original membership two Soviet Socialist Republics, i.e., the Ukraine
  and White Russia. </li></ol></li>
  <li> That the United States Government, on behalf of the three powers, should
  consult the Government of China and the French Provisional Government in regard
  to decisions taken at the present conference concerning the proposed World Organization.<br>
  &#133;</li></ol>
</p>
<p>C. Voting<br>
  &quot;1. Each member of the Security Council should have one vote. <br>
  &quot;2. Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters should be made
  by an affirmative vote of seven members.<br>
  &quot;3. Decisions of the Security Council on all matters should be made by
  an affirmative vote of seven members, including the concurring votes of the
  permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VIII, Section A
  and under the second sentence of Paragraph 1 of Chapter VIII, Section C, a party
  to a dispute should abstain from voting.'</p>
<p>&#133;</p>
<p><a name="DLE"></a>II. DECLARATION OF LIBERATED EUROPE<br>
  The following declaration has been approved:<br>
  &#133;<br>
  The establishment of order in Europe and the rebuilding of national economic
  life must be achieved by processes which will enable the liberated peoples to
  destroy the last vestiges of nazism and fascism and to create democratic institutions
  of their own choice. This is a principle of the Atlantic Charter - the right
  of all people to choose the form of government under which they will live -
  the restoration of sovereign rights and self-government to those peoples who
  have been forcibly deprived of them by the aggressor nations.<br>
  To foster the conditions in which the liberated people may exercise these rights,
  the three governments will jointly assist the people in any European liberated
  state or former Axis state in Europe where, in their judgment conditions require,
  <ol class="lalpha"><li>to establish conditions of internal peace;</li>
  <li> to carry out emergency relief measures for the relief of distressed peoples;</li>
  <li> to form interim governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in the population
  and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of
  Governments responsive to the will of the people; and </li>
  <li> to facilitate where necessary the holding of such elections.</li></ol>
  &#133;</p>
<p><br>
  <a name="REP"></a>V. REPARATION<br>
  The following protocol has been approved:<br>
  Protocol<br>
  On the Talks Between the Heads of Three Governments at the Crimean Conference
  on the Question of the German Reparations in Kind <br>
  <ol class="lroman"><li>Germany must pay in kind for the losses caused by her to the Allied nations
  in the course of the war. Reparations are to be received in the first instance
  by those countries which have borne the main burden of the war, have suffered
  the heaviest losses and have organized victory over the enemy.</li>
<li> Reparation in kind is to be exacted from Germany in three following forms:<br>
  <ol class="lalpha"><li> Removals &#133; of equipment, machine tools, ships, rolling stock, German
  investments abroad, shares of industrial, transport &#133; these removals to
  be carried out chiefly for the purpose of destroying the war potential of Germany.</li>
  <li>(b) Annual deliveries of goods from current production for a period to be fixed.</li>
  <li>(c) Use of German labour.</li></ol>
  </li>
<li> For the working out on the above principles of a detailed plan for exaction
  of reparation from Germany an Allied reparation commission will be set up in
  Moscow. It will consist of three representatives - one from the Union of Soviet
  Socialist Republics, one from the United Kingdom and one from the United States
  of America.</li>
<li> With regard to the fixing of the total sum of the reparation as well as
  the distribution of it among the countries which suffered from the German aggression,
  the Soviet and American delegations agreed as follows:<br>
  &quot;The Moscow reparation commission should take in its initial studies as
  a basis for discussion the suggestion of the Soviet Government that the total
  sum of the reparation in accordance with the points (a) and (b) of the Paragraph
  2 should be 22 billion dollars and that 50 per cent should go to the Union of
  Soviet Socialist Republics.&quot;</li>
  </ol>
<p>The British delegation was of the opinion that, pending consideration of the
  reparation question by the Moscow reparation commission, no figures of reparation
  should be mentioned.<br>
