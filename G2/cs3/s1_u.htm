<ul>
  <li>The Yalta Conference took place in February 1945. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Yalta was in the Crimea region of the USSR. As they travelled to Yalta both
    Churchill and Roosevelt saw the devastation which the German invasion had
    caused to the region. <br>
  </li>
  <li>At the time of the Conference Roosevelt was very ill, although this was
    kept secret. He only had a couple of months to live. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Yalta Conference ended in a Protocol (agreement) which all of the Big
    Three signed, although they later interpreted it slightly differently. There
    were 14 sections to the Yalta Protocol. The main sections dealt with:<br>
   <ul><li> The setting up of the United Nations Organisation. </li>
    <li> Declaration on Liberated Europe which said that all countries liberated
    from German rule would be free to choose their own system of government.</li>
    <li> The occupation of Germany and making Germany pay reparations. </li>
    <li> Tracking down war criminals.</li>
    <li> Borders in Eastern Europe (especially Poland) and SE Europe (especially
    Yugoslavia). </li></ul>
  </li>
