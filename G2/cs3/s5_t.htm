<p>1. I am profoundly concerned about the European situation as outlined in my
  No. 41. [an earlier telegram] I learn that half the American Air Force in Europe
  has already begun to move to the Pacific theatre. The newspapers are full of
  the great movements of the American Armies out of Europe. Our Armies also are
  under previous arrangements likely to undergo a marked reduction. The Canadian
  Army will certainly leave. The French are weak and difficult to deal with. Anyone
  can see that in a very short space of time our armed power on the Continent
  will have vanished except for moderate forces to hold down Germany.</p>
<p>2. Meanwhile what is to happen about Russia? I have always worked for friendship
  with Russia but, like you, I feel deep anxiety because of their misinterpretation
  of the Yalta decisions, their attitude towards Poland, their overwhelming influence
  in the Balkans excepting Greece, the difficulties they make about Vienna, the
  combination of Russian power and the territories under their control or occupied,
  coupled with the Communist technique in so many other countries, and above all
  their power to maintain very large Armies in the field for a long time. What
  will be the position in a year or two, when the British and American Armies
  have melted and the French has not yet been formed on any major scale, when
  we may have a handful of divisions mostly French, and when Russia may choose
  to keep two or three hundred on active service? </p>
