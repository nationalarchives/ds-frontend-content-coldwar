      <p class="s_greenbody"><b>The Background<br>
        </b> Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev came to power in 1955. At first it 
        seemed that he would be a new type of Soviet leader, keen to co-operate 
        with the West. In some ways he was, but he was also anxious not to be 
        seen as weak. By the early 1960s his main concerns were nuclear weapons 
        (see Gallery 5) and Eastern Europe. His biggest concern in Eastern Europe 
        was Germany:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There had never been an actual peace treaty signed with Germany at 
          the end of World War 2. Germany had simply been divided into West Germany 
          (friendly to the West) and East Germany (friendly to the USSR).</li>
        <li>West German leaders were keen to see Germany reunited. However, West 
          Germany joined NATO in 1955, but East Germany was part of the Warsaw 
          Pact. </li>
        <li>Khrushchev's Communist allies in Poland were worried that if Germany 
          was reunified then it might try to take control of territory on the 
          Polish - German border.</li>
        <li>Then there was Berlin. Khrushchev believed that the US, French and 
          British were simply using Berlin as a staging post for spying on the 
          USSR (he was not entirely wrong!). </li>
        <li>Worse still, Berlin provided an easy route for East Germans to flee 
          Communist East Germany and seek better jobs and more freedom in West 
          Germany. And they went in their thousands. This was humiliating and 
          damaged the East German economy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>The Wall<br>
        </b> So, by 1961 Khrushchev wanted a final solution to the question of 
        Germany. He wanted a peace treaty signed which made it clear there would 
        be no reunited Germany, and he also wanted to stop the flow of refugees 
        from East Berlin. </p>

      He decided the best way was to show the Western powers that he meant business. 
      Throughout the summer of 1961 it was obvious to Berliners that something 
      was going on. Then, on August 13th 1961, barbed wire barricades went up, 
      dividing the city. They were soon reinforced by concrete walls. Movement 
      of military and civilian personnel was restricted. There was outrage. US 
      and Soviet tanks faced each other in Berlin, and for a short while a real 
      war rather than a Cold War looked possible. 
      <p>In the end, however, all sides accepted the wall. President Kennedy was 
        deeply critical of the wall, but even he pointed out that 'a wall is a 
        lot better than a war'. </p>
      <p> <b>Your Task<br>
        </b> Your task is to study the sources on the Berlin Wall and decide what 
        they tell historians about how the Cold War worked. You will also have 
        to decide which sources you want to use in your exhibition. </p>
      <p>The worksheet will help you to keep track of your work. </p>
