  <li>This document was the script of a film in a series called British Calendar.
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>British Calendar was produced by the British Government's Ministry of Information.
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Ministry of Information films covered almost any subject you could think
    of, from safety in the home to what to do in the event of a nuclear attack.
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>British Calendar's aim was to inform the British public more widely about
    the events taking place in the wider world which concerned Britain. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The sections labelled SEQUENCE refer to the film footage being shown while
    the text of the script is read out over the film footage. <br>
