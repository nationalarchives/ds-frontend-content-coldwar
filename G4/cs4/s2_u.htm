  <li>This document is a report of the July meeting of the officials who governed
    Berlin in 1961. They met once a month.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The government of West Berlin was rather complicated. It involved military
    governors from the French, US and British forces. It also involved the civilian
    mayor of Berlin who was elected by the German people of the city. The Mayor
    was Willy Brandt.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The chairman for this particular meeting was a British general. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Their main topic of discussion was the refugees coming from East Germany
    to West Germany through West Berlin. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Dr Adenauer was the Chancellor (leader) of West Germany. This state had
    been created in 1949 from the French, British and American zones of Germany.</li>
