  <li>This film is a collection of clips taken in the period August 13th to August
    16th 1961.<br>
  </li>
  <li>East German and Soviet workers and troops began the wall by marking out
    the borders of the Soviet zone with wooden barricades and barbed wire. This
    work took place in the middle of the night on August 13th. <br>
  </li>
  <li>There were many commuters between East and West Berlin - many found themselves
    cut off from their work or their homes.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Not surprisingly, there was a panic to get out before the border was completely
    sealed. <br>
  </li>
  <li>In some areas, like Friedrichstrasse, there was no actual wall at first,
    but buildings on the border line between East and West Berlin had doors and
    windows bricked up after East Berliners were found to be using these to escape.</li>
