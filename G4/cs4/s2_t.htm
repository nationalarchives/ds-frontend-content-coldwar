<p>1 Refugees</p>
<p>The Chairman said that numbers had recently considerably increased and the
  commandants were conscious of a great increase in the strain on the existing
  machinery. They were doing all they could to see that no delays occurred <br>
  &#133; </p>
<p>Since last Monday the Allies had all decided to work a seven day week as long
  as this remained necessary and they would do all they possibly could to make
  the whole process work smoothly.<br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>The Governing Mayor said he was most grateful for this assurance. A fortnight
  ago some difficulties had arisen through Departments not working on Saturdays
  but this was now settled and he had no objections whatever in the light of the
  decisions made. He still however, was of the opinion that there were too many
  offices involved and that a good solution would be the setting up of a new reception
  centre and a general agreement as to which offices should be established there.
  It was not reasonable that there should be as many as eight Intelligence Offices
  involved and there was also too much bureaucratic delay. This was not however
  a problem which could be solved at the moment. What was needed was to concentrate
  on the measures necessary to cope with an increased inflow of something over
  3000 a week - the drop in numbers in the last day or two was not expected to
  last. <br>
