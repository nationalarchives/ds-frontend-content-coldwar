<p>NO HOPE FOR THE HUNGARIANS<br>
  Few political conferences can ever have held out less hope for the future than
  the Hungarian Party Congress &#133; the Kadar regime has given notice that,
  despite the complete disenchantment and apathy of the people, the Communisation
  of the country is to proceed without any relaxation of police State methods.
</p>
<p>Soviet troops are to remain in the country and with this promise of continued
  backing from Moscow the harsh measures to suppress dissidence and enforce conformity
  are to continue - particularly amongst the young and the intelligentsia where
  unorthodoxy is most prevalent - and the protests of the free world will be defied
  as before.</p>
<p>Further improvements in the country's economic situation and the people's standard
  of living may be expected - but always in conformity with, and subordinate to,
  the requirements of Soviet bloc plans, which may not always coincide with the
  welfare of the Hungarian people. In particular, the resumption of the collectivisation
  drive will cause hardships</p>
<p>The Congress has probably confirmed most Hungarians in their feeling that the
  endurance contest which they are waging against the re-imposition of Soviet
  Communism will be very long and very hard.<br>
  &#133; </p>
<p>No Soviet Withdrawal<br>
  For several months prior, it was strongly rumoured that there would be an announcement
  at the Congress of the withdrawal of the Soviet troops &#133; who have remained
  in Hungary since they crushed the October, 1956, Uprising. But such hopes were
  dashed by Kadar in his opening speech &#133; <br>
