<ul>
  <li>This report was sent to London by a British observer in Hungary in 1959.
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>After the revolt was crushed, Khrushchev appointed Janos Kadar as the new
    leader of Hungary. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Kadar imprisoned around 30 000 Hungarians after the revolt. Around 300 were
    executed, including Imre Nagy. <br>
  </li>
  <li>One of the biggest factors in Hungarian discontent before the rising was
    collectivisation. This meant taking small farmers land away and making them
    work in large collective farms. This was very unpopular with Hungary's farmers.<br>
  </li>
  <li>As well as the issues described here, the Party Conference discussed the
    uprising. They claimed to have done an extensive investigation into the uprising.
    They said the strongest factors in causing the uprising were international
    imperialist forces led by the USA. <br>
