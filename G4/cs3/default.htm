      <p><span class="s_greenbody"><b>The Background<br>
        </b></span>In 1944 and 1945 the Red Army drove across Eastern Europe in 
        its fight against the Nazis. After the war, Stalin was determined that 
        the USSR would control Eastern Europe. That way, Germany or any other 
        state would not be able to use countries like Hungary or Poland as a staging 
        post to invade. His policy was simple. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each Eastern European state had a Communist government loyal to the 
          USSR. </li>
        <li>Each state's economy was tied to the economy of the USSR.</li>
        <li>If Communist control was threatened, each state could use its own 
          army or secret police, or call on the Red Army for help. </li>
        <li>The Warsaw Pact of 1955 bound all of the Eastern European states closely 
          to the USSR. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Stalin died in 1953 and by 1955 a new policy seemed to be developing. 
        The new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev seemed to want better relations 
        with the West and reform in the USSR. In Eastern Europe, they hoped for 
        less tight Soviet control. In 1956 Khrushchev gave various concessions 
        to Poland. </p>
      <p><b>Hungary 1956</b><br>
        The events in Poland gave hope to Hungary. Hungarians were fed up with 
        many aspects of Communist rule. However, the main reason they began protesting 
        in October 1956 was probably to do with their national pride. They resented 
        the increasing number of Russian officials, advisers, security officers 
        and technical experts who they felt were taking over their country. Protests 
        began in the summer of 1956 but by October the Moscow backed Hungarian 
        leaders were pushed out and the popular Imre Nagy took over. He brought 
        in a series of radical policies. The most radical of all was his plan 
        to make Hungary a neutral state and pull out of the Warsaw Pact. This 
        was too much for Soviet leader Khrushchev who sent in tanks and troops 
        to crush the revolt. It was bloody and brutal, with thousands of casualties. 
        The Western powers protested, but they knew they could do little to help 
        Hungary in what was the USSR's 'back yard'. </p>

        <b>Czechoslovakia 1968</b><br>
        Czechs were traditionally more friendly to the USSR and more in favour 
        of Communism than the other Eastern European states. Despite this, by 
        1968 they felt that the Communist party needed to reform. It needed new 
        economic policies and needed to be more open and encourage free speech. 
        In early 1968 this feeling brought Alexander Dubcek to power in Czechoslovakia. 
        There was a new Soviet leader by this time as well - Leonid Brezhnev. 
        He watched anxiously as Dubcek reformed Czech economic policies and allowed 
        the Czech media to interrogate Communist party leaders live on radio and 
        TV. Unlike Hungary, Dubcek was a loyal supporter of the Warsaw Pact. Like 
        Hungary, he went too far for the Soviet leader and the tanks moved in 
        to Prague in August 1968. There was fighting, but not as serious as in 
        Hungary 12 years earlier. Again, the West protested, but was unable to 
        take any serious action.</p>
      <p><b>Your Task</b><br>
        Your task is to study the sources on the Hungary 1956 and Czechoslovakia 
        1968 and decide what they tell historians about how the Cold War worked. 
        You will also have to decide which sources you want to use in your exhibition. 
      </p>
      <p>The worksheet will help you to keep track of your work.</p>
