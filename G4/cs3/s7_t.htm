<p>The Foreign Secretary said that we did not know the strength of the Warsaw
  Pact forces that had invaded Czechoslovakia on the night of 20th-2lst August,
  but it was clear that their grip on the country was complete although some free
  radio stations were still operating. </p>
<p>Ground forces of the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland and Bulgaria were involved
  together with Soviet air forces. There were also indications of an increased
  level of activity in the Soviet long-range air and rocket forces but these did
  not appear to be in a high state of alert. </p>
<p>A remarkable feature of the political situation was that no Czech leader had
  so far shown himself willing to act as a Soviet puppet. Mr Dubcek, the Secretary
  of the Czech Communist Party, and others were in detention, but President Svoboda
  had issued a statement on the previous evening calling for the withdrawal of
  the invading troops and for the liberalisation programme in Czechoslovakia to
  continue; it might be, however, that the Soviet authorities hoped that he would
  be prepared to cooperate with them. </p>
<p>The Czech people were behaving with very great restraint and, although there 
  had been some deaths, widespread bloodshed did not seem likely. It was not clear 
  why the Soviet Union had resorted to military action, despite the agreement 
  reached at Bratislava; it might be that they did not consider that censorship 
  was being sufficiently rigidly imposed by the Czech Government as a result of 
  the agreement or that they feared the outcome of the elections for the Presidum 
  of the Communist Party which were clue to take place on 9th September. </p>
