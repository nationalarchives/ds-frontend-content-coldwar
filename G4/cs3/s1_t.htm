</p>
<p>The cold war is entering into a new phase. For some months past, the Soviet
  leaders have been showing marked elasticity and imagination in the conduct of
  their diplomacy. Even under Malenkov, the Soviet Government settled a number
  of outstanding questions with the West. </p>
<p>These were, for the most part, of a minor nature. The Bulganin-Khrushchev regime
  has carried the process much further. They have agreed to an Austrian Treaty.
  They have made a serious effort to re-establish their relations with Tito's
  Yugoslavia, They have made overtures to the German Federal Republic. The proposals
  which Mr Malik presented to the Disarmament Sub-Committee in London on May 10,
  represented a definite move towards the Western position on disarmament. </p>
<p>This trend has been accompanied by a generally more cordial approach to the
  West. For example, the Soviet press are now reporting on developments in the
  Western world more objectively than for many years. This changed attitude was
  very noticeable at Geneva where the Soviet leaders were clearly intent on establishing
  closer and more friendly relations with their Western colleagues' There seems
  no doubt that it is their present wish to reduce international tension to ensure
  that Soviet relations with the non-Communist world should have a more normal
  appearance.<br>
