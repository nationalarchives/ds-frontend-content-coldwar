<p>October 25th 1956<br>
  The Hungarian Tricolours without the Communist emblem, now flying on many public
  and other buildings throughout the city, while orderly crowds carrying their
  flags and singing patriotic songs are moving about at will. Without controlling
  the Government they appear to have come as close to controlling Budapest as
  is ever likely. </p>
<p>2 But casualties have been very severe, even amongst the women and children,
  and the populace are terrified of massive reprisals. The success of this revolt
  against Communism is clearly in the balance and, as I see it, we have a magnificent
  opportunity to tip the scales. Is there not justification for placing the situation
  at once before the United Nations, giving the widest publicity to our action
  &#133;.</p>
<p>October 26th 1956<br>
  Use of railway wagons, tram lines, flagstones, and anything else on which they
  can lay hands, large crowds have, from early this morning, been erecting barricades
  beyond Var and other hills of Buda. Their intention appears to be to prevent
  Russian reinforcements entering the town &#133;</p>
<p>2 Heavy fire has continued throughout the day Gellert hill region &#133; Heavy
  mortar and tank fire is in progress now on eastern outskirts of Pest and fighting
  has also spread to new areas of Buda &#133;</p>
<p>3 Unconfirmed reports continue to reach me that units of Hungarian army are
  attempting to enter Budapest to assist the people. True or not, it is obvious
  that the people could not have resisted so long and so successfully without
  help from the Hungarian Army and access to its equipment &#133;</p>
<p>4 Such news as I have from the country is confined to wireless broadcasts which
  will already be available in London. I am told that Miskolc wireless station
  is in the hands of the Nationalists and is broadcasting on 345 metres. </p>
<p>5 the political situation is, if anything, more confused than the military
  &#133; <br>
