<ul>
  <li>This report was produced for the Foreign Office by someone
    living in Czechoslovakia in 1956. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The report is based on a booklet published by the Communist
    Party in Czechoslovakia. The booklet sets out the aims of Communist government
    in Czechoslovakia. The report sums up what was said in the booklet. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The 'People's Democracies' means the Eastern European
    states ruled by Communism and allied to the USSR. <br>
  </li>
  <li>In Stalin's time (up to 1953), the economies of all these
    states were planned and organised by COMECON in Moscow. This organisation
    decided how much each country should produce of goods like food, coal, steel
    etc. Many critics of COMECON said that all the industries of Eastern Europe
    were simply producing for the benefit of the USSR. <br>
  </li>
  <li>At the time of the report (and booklet) Khrushchev
    had just emerged as the new Soviet leader. He favoured economic reform and
    improved relations with the West, Yugoslavia and China. <br>
