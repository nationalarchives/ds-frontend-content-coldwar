<ul>
  <li>This letter was written by a British Foreign Official working in Moscow
    at the time the Korean War broke out. <br>
  </li>
  <li>One of his many jobs was to write back to London and keep the Foreign Office
    informed about what the Soviet press was saying about important issues. <br>
  </li>
  <li>In this particular report he is explaining how, in his opinion, the Soviet
    people were prepared for a conflict with the USA. <br>
  </li>
  <li>At the time of the Korean War, there were many different areas of dispute
    between the USA and the Communist powers. One of the most serious causes of
    tension was the successful Communist revolution in China in 1949. The USA
    refused to accept that the new Communist regime was the true government of
    China. <br>
  </li>
  <li>As a result, the invasion of South Korea was something of a surprise. <br>
  </li>
