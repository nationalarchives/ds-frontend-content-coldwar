<p>FOR THE PRESS<br>
  JANUARY 29 1951<br>
  No 73</p>
<p>Following is the text of remarks by the Honourable Dean Rusk, Assistant Secretary
  for Far Eastern Affairs, on the National Broadcasting Company Television show,
  &quot;Battle Report,&quot; Sunday, January 28, 1951: </p>
<p>Today I wish to say a word to those who ask why we stay in Korea. It is a serious
  question - because men's lives are at stake - and it deserves a serious answer.</p>
<p>We are in Korea because we are trying to prevent a world war and the frightful
  destruction of life which such a war would produce<br>
  &#133; </p>
<p>The issue in Korea is aggression. We can face it, or we can run away from it. 
  If we face it, we have a chance -to organize the determination of the world 
  against aggression, to show the aggressor that his crime will not be accepted 
  and his crime will not pay. If we succeed the aggressor will hold his hand. 
  If we run away from it the aggressor will learn that there is great profit in 
  crime , that he will not be resisted, and that his victims are weak and can 
  be destroyed at will. <br>
  &#133; </p>
<p>We are in Korea because we cannot afford to leave Red China and Its neighbours 
  under the Impression that the forces of Peking are irresistible and that Red 
  China's neighbours must now come to terms with communism at the cost of their 
  freedom. The vaunted power of Red China is being unmasked in Korea. Chinese 
  soldiers do not relish the punishment they are getting from our guns and planes 
  and ships. They are learning that their masters have tricked them into a war 
  of foreign aggression. They are learning that their masters have put them into 
  battle without provision for minimum care in case of wounds or sickness or frostbite. 
  In other words. Red China is learning a great deal about the cost of aggression. 
</p>
<p>We are in Korea because we cannot abandon 20 million gallant Koreans to communism.
  We and they have fought side by side against aggression for several months,
  sometimes in defeat and sometimes in victory. We cannot now abandon our comrades
  to the fate which would be theirs if the Communists took over. </p>
<p>Further, we cannot leave our friends in the Philippines and in Japan under
  the impression that we do not take our commitments seriously and that we might
  lack courage in the face of adversity &#133;</p>
