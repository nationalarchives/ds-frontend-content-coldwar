<ul>
  <li>This is part of a report written by British Royal
    Marines Captain REE King. He was assigned to join up with the South Korean
    forces and other UN forces and help to improve cooperation and communications
    between the different forces in the UN force. <br>
    </li>
  <li>King travelled extensively in late 1950 and early
    1951 and sent back detailed reports to his commanders. He sent reports on
    the South Korean troops, and also on the general conditions in which fighting
    was taking place. <br>
    </li>
  <li>This section of his report details his impression
    of the North Korean forces. On the whole he was impressed by the North Koreans
    even though they were his enemies. <br>
    </li>
  <li>His main sources of information were the South
    Korean officers he was working with, talking to North Korean prisoners and
    his own observations of the fighting. He included a number of photographs
    with his report. <br>
    </li>
  <li>A few technical terms: self propelled guns were
    motorised artillery weapons which could move around easily rather than having
    to be towed; ROK's means Republic of Korea troops - South Koreans; quilted
    uniforms were heavy, warm coats common in Korea and China; rice balls were
    tightly packed balls of cooked rice - easy to eat in combat conditions.</span><br>
