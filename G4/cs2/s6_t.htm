<p>United Kingdom Liaison Mission in Japan<br>
  Tokyo<br>
  7th January 1952</p>
<p>As far as an armistice is concerned it has always seemed to me that we shall
  get one if the communists want one but not otherwise. We have thought in the
  past that for their own good reasons they do want one, but the slowness of the
  negotiations has surely demonstrated that they are in no great hurry.<br>
  &#133; </p>
<p> It is easy to criticise the conduct of the armistice negotiations, but in 
  fairness to the Americans I think it must be said that they have done as well 
  as might have been expected given their temperament and the circumstances. On 
  occasion it has seemed to me that they have been at least as much responsible 
  for delay as the Communists, and it is a pity that the American inspired press 
  here should take the uncompromisingly hostile attitude it does, since I have 
  no doubt this is known in Peking. Given this attitude, it would hardly be surprising 
  if the Communists are as suspicious of us as we rightly are of them.<br>
