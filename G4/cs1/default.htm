      <p class="s_greenbody"><b>The Background<br>
        </b>After the defeat of Germany in 1945 
        the country was divided into four zones. Each zone was controlled by a 
        different country - Britain, USA, France, USSR. Germany's capital Berlin 
        was also divided into four zones. However, Berlin was deep inside Soviet 
        territory. As a result, West Berlin became a very clear example of the 
        contrasting attitudes of Stalin towards Germany and the attitudes of the 
        other three powers. </p>
      <p class="s_greenbody">Stalin's attitude was harsh but understandable. Germany 
        had caused appalling damage to the USSR. As a result Germany would not 
        be allowed to become strong again. It would also have to pay compensation 
        to the USSR in machinery, money and even German workers. </p>
      <p class="s_greenbody">US President Truman felt Stalin's policy was wrong. 
        He had seen how the harsh Treaty of Versailles had caused another World 
        War. He also now feared Stalin more than Germany. He saw a democratic 
        Germany as a possible future ally against the USSR. </p>
      <p class="s_greenbody">To achieve this, Germany would have to recover. In 
        1946 the three Western powers joined their zones to form one Germany. 
        In 1948 they brought in a new currency. With Marshall Aid money Germany's 
        industries began to recover. </p>
      <p class="s_greenbody">Stalin saw this as an insult to the Soviet victims 
        of WW2. He also saw it as a threat. The worst aspect of Truman's policy 
        was seeing West Berlin recovering while Soviet controlled East Berlin 
        and the regions around Berlin struggled to pay their debts to the USSR.

      <p class="s_greenbody"><b>The Berlin Blockade and Airlift</b><br>
        Stalin decided that the Western powers would have to be driven from West 
        Berlin. In the summer of 1948 he blocked all road, rail and water links 
        to West Berlin from the Western zones. With these supply lines blocked, 
        Stalin thought that the West would have to withdraw and leave West Berlin 
        to him. </p>
      <p class="s_greenbody">As events showed, Stalin underestimated Truman. The 
        Western Allies decided to bring essential supplies to West Berlin by air. 
        It was a huge operation and lasted almost a year. In the end, Stalin saw 
        that Truman would not give in so he ended the Blockade. </p>

        </b> Your task is to study the sources on the Berlin Blockade and decide 
        what they tell historians about how the Cold War worked. You will also 
        have to decide which sources you want to use in your exhibition. </span></p>
