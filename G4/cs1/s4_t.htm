  September 12, 1948</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  President Harry S. Truman,<br>
  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,<br>
  Washington D.C.</p>
<p><br>
  Dear Sir:</p>
<p> The so-called &quot;Berlin Crisis&quot; is entirely an outgrowth of your own
  incredible stupidity. When you attended the Potsdam Conference to arrange final
  details for the occupation of Germany, it was your duty to look out for American
  interests and insist upon the establishment of a corridor to the American Zone
  for ingress and egress to the city. This you failed to do. Possibly this was
  because Joe Stalin to be a &quot;good old chap,&quot; as you expressed it some
  time ago. But I am inclined to think that you were just too dumb to know that
  such a corridor was necessary.</p>
<p> In the meantime, you seem to be willing and even eager to force this country
  into a war with Russia merely for the purpose of &quot;saving face.&quot; If
  you do this, the blame for such a war will rest upon your own shoulders, and
  the blood of American boys butchered in this war will be on your head.</p>
<p> Read the enclosed article from the Los Angeles Times of September 12, and
  then perhaps even your feeble mind will grasp the fact that the Berlin Crisis
  can be solved without dragging the United States into war.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>PHILLIP JOHNSTON<br>
  From the Los Angeles Times<br>
  September 12, 1948</p>
<p>West Can Pull Out of Berlin Proudly<br>
  BY POLYZOIDES</p>
<p>With the current rapid sequence of events in Berlin bordering on the fantastic,
  there are still a few optimists clinging to the hope that a mutually satisfactory
  arrangement will eventually be reached between Washington and Moscow. How this
  will happen and on what terms, nobody so far seems to be able to indulge.<br>
  The struggle for supremacy in the ruined German capital continues unabated with
  the anti-communist elements in the majority, but with the Communists enjoying
  the fullest support of the Red army and its Berlin leaders.</p>
<p>AIR LIFT PERILED<br>
  After the recent repeated meetings between the three western representatives
  and Stalin the hope was expressed that the Berlin blockade was about to be lifted.
  Yet not only the blockade continues but even our air communications between
  the western zones and the capital are now placed in jeopardy, with the Russians
  intent upon severing that last link between the American, British and French
  zones of Western Germany and their Berlin sectors.<br>
  At the same time the seizure of the Berlin City Hall by the Communists appears
  to be only a matter of time, all our protests notwithstanding.<br>
  When that happens, as it is most likely, not to say certain, to happen, the
  position of the western powers will be far more difficult than it is now.</p>
<p>RUSS HOLDS TRUMPS<br>
  Russia is holding the trump cards in Berlin and will only give in at a price
  that may prove too high for the western powers to pay. Besides, any bargain
  that one may strike with Moscow today by grants of credits, shipment of free
  goods, acceptance of Communist control of Berlin, elimination of all currency
  except the Russian-sponsored mark from Berlin, can at best be only temporary.<br>
  No-one expects Stalin to live up to his commitments a month, a week or a day
  after he has given them. In which case one may well ask, why make the concessions
  to the Russians in the first place?<br>
  This question is more than a diplomatic and political conundrum: it is one of
  peace and tranquillity in Germany and in Europe &#133; it may well prove to
  be one between war and peace.<br>
  Even a most superficial study of the recent activities and attitudes of Russia
  in Berlin will convince any sensible person that Moscow is staging an intensive
  effort to drive the western Allies to despair and hence to a declaration of
  war, in which the Americans, the British and French will be branded the aggressors.
  This is the sort of trap that Stalin has set for the west and the west should
  be very careful not to play into Stalin's hands.<br>
  This is the eleventh hour of the crisis between the east and west, but it is
  not too late to take a supreme decision that may not entirely save the faces
  of Washington, London and Paris but will save the peace of Europe which is by
  far the most important. The longer the division of Berlin into four sectors
  continues and the longer the western allies remain there as targets of constant
  humiliations by the Soviet power, the greater the danger of an explosion that
  will plunge Europe and the world into another conflict.</p>
<p>CAN PULL OUT<br>
  The western Allies can pull out of Berlin proudly and with every evidence of
  dignity and get back to their own zones on the excellent ground that co-operation
  with Russia is no longer possible. They can then establish their military, economic
  and political front along their Russian border and meet the Soviets on better
  than even terms.<br>
  When the westerners have made that decision, they should supplement it with
  the withdrawal of their Ambassadors from Moscow, leaving their Embassies in
  charge of minor officials for the transaction of routine business alone. At
  the same time the Soviet Ambassadors shall be told that their presence in Washington,
  London and Paris is no longer desired.<br>
  One might object that such a move will be tantamount to the breaking of diplomatic
  relations, in which case it is well to be reminded that for all practical purposes
  such relations between the western powers and Russia have long been nonexistent.
