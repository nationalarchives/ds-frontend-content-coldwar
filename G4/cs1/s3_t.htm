<p>1 The blockade of Berlin was the result of a situation which developed mainly
  as a consequence of decisions made during the war. It was the climax of one
  phase of a planned and deliberate attempt by the Russians to force the Western
  allies out of Berlin. <br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>4 The Potsdam Agreement consisted of a comparatively short statement of principle
  and was not a statute book for the government of Germany. Consequently, co-operation
  and good faith on the part of the allies was required in co-ordinated and effective
  government of Berlin was to be obtained. Unfortunately, the Russian attitude
  prevented this. <br>
  &#133;</p>
<p>5 Owing to this lack of collaboration, the four power control of Berlin was
  bound to fail and gradually the administration of the Eastern and Western sectors
  of the city grew farther apart until the sectors became virtually two separate
  cities with separate city governments and separate police forces. The split
  between the two sectors was made complete by the Allied currency reform which
  was introduced in June 1948. This was caused by the Soviets refusal to co-operate
  and resulted in each sector having a different currency. <br>
