<ul>
  <li>Many military operations involved sitting around for long periods of time
    while important preparations were made. The Berlin Airlift was no exception.
    This was not a relaxing time. Aircrews had to sit around waiting tensely for
    their flight to begin. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Several American cartoonists commented on this problem. One anonymous cartoonist
    produced the famous Fassberg diary. This was a joke diary of the Berlin Blockade,
    and ended with the fliers still transporting goods into Berlin in the year
    3200! <br>
  </li>
  <li>This cartoon was by Sergeant Jake Schuffert. He drew cartoons most days
    in the Task Force Times. This was the newspaper produced by the US government
    especially for the Berlin Airlift and blockade.</li>
