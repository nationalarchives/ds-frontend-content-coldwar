2. The Cabinet were informed that no progress had been made in the quadripartite
discussion on the possibility of introducing a single currency for the whole of
Berlin, and that early on the previous day it had been announced that the new
currency for the Soviet Zone would be introduced into the whole of Berlin. The
Military Governors of the Western Zone had countered this by announcing that the
new currency for the Western Zones would be introduced into the western sectors
of Berlin. Early that morning the Soviet authorities had stopped all rail traffic
between Berlin and the Western Zones and all electricity supplied from the eastern
to the western sectors of Berlin. It was not yet clear whether these restrictions
were designed as a tactical reply to the action taken by the Western powers on
the currency question or whether they were the first move in a major offensive
to force the Western Powers to withdraw from Berlin. Our Military Governor had
been asked for a full report on the situation and this was expected by noon.The
Cabinet recognised that a very serious situation might develop in Berlin; and
it was important that the Western Powers should take their stand on a position
which they were confident of being able to sustain. The Minister of State undertook
to arrange that the Foreign Secretary should be fully informed of the situation
without delay. As soon as the promised report on the situation was received, he
would also consider, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary and the Prime
Minister, whether the British Military Governor in Berlin should be recalled to
London for consultation with Ministers.

  3. The British Deputy Military Governor in Germany informed the Cabinet of the
  latest developments in the situation in Berlin. The British garrison could be
  supplied by air, and arrangements for this purpose would be brought into operation
  in the following week. Food stocks were sufficient to supply the civil population
  in the British sector for twenty-seven days. The electricity generating stations
  controlled by the Western Powers could meet about 50 per cent. of the electricity
  requirements in the Western sectors of tne city. The German people in those
  sectors were calm, and the majority of them were ready to resist Russian orders
  if they were confident that they would continue to receive the support of the
  Western Powers. It would be useful if the British Military Governors could be
  authorised to make it clear that the Russian authorities were to blame for any
  inconvenience or suffering arising from the suspension of land communications
  between the Western Zones of Germany and the Western sectors of Berlin. </p>
<p>June 28th 1948<br>
  4. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in
  the situation in Germany. In view of the suggestions published in the Soviet-controlled
  press in Berlin, the Foreign Office had issued a statement over the week-end
  confirming the Government's intention to maintain their position in Berlin and
  the United States Government were being asked to make a similar statement. There
  could be no question of yielding to Soviet pressure; if the Western Allies were
  forced out of Berlin, the project of Western Union would be fatally weakened.
  Every effort must be made to increase the existing food stocks for the civil
  population in the British sector of the city. This could now be done by air
  alone, and steps had been taken to expand the air services into the city. It
  seemed possible that the Soviet Government might try to secure an agreement
  on Four-Power control of the Ruhr in return for permitting the resumption of
  rail and water traffic into the Western Zones. There was no foundation for their
  allegation that we were failing to carry out the terms of an agreement on this
  issue &#133; <br>
