      <p class="s_bluebody">As the threat of a nuclear strike against the UK became 
        a reality, the Government undertook the huge task of updating the country's 
        defences. By 1951 construction had begun on a chain of concrete bunkers 
        around the country to act as command centres for the deployment and firing 
        of our anti-aircraft defences. These were called Anti Aircraft Operations 
        Rooms (AAORs). However, the rapid development of the jet plane and the 
        advances of science meant that these operations centres only had an active 
        life of three years and, by 1954, most of the sites had fallen redundant. 
        The AAORs had originally received their command instructions from the 
        national defence early warning system, 'ROTOR', which comprised a chain 
        of vast underground radar stations along the coastline. This system also 
        became redundant due to the increased power of radar, new missile technology 
        and the development of the jet engine. </p>
      <p class="s_bluebody">During the 1950's and 1960's, therefore, although 
        a number of sites were retained by the Ministry of Defence and other Government 
        departments, many were sold off. In the case of 'FURZE HILL' (Mistley), 
        the centre was purchased by Essex County Council and became their Emergency 
        Headquarters for the whole county in the event of a nuclear war. The bunker 
        had cost some &pound;500,000 to build in 1951 but, in 1963, the county 
        purchased the site from the War Office for just &pound;5,250. (The cost 
        of building it today would be about &pound;18 million). Every county was 
        required by central government to have such an HQ so Essex County Council 
        were very fortunate, being able to take over this heavily protected site 
        at little cost and thus save themselves vast amounts of money which other 
        less fortunate counties were having to spend. </p>
      <p class="s_bluebody">However, by 1993, with the ending of the Cold War, 
        the government decided to lift the requirement for each county to maintain 
        such an HQ and Essex County Council were able to close their Emergency 
        Centres. The Council, however, wished to see the site preserved and in 
        early 1995 the building was renovated and refurbished prior to opening 
        as a public tourist attraction. This work was undertaken by the same team 
        that was responsible for the WWI 1 war rooms at Dover Castle - 'Hellfire 
        Corner', the Liverpool 'Battle of the Atlantic' war rooms and the central 
        government 'Secret Bunker' in Scotland.</p>
      <p class="s_bluebody">Over 80 tons of original equipment was returned to 
        the site, much of it being donated by the Home Office, the MOD, the Defence 
        Forces, the Police, BT, local councils and other groups. As a result, 
        the FURZE HILL bunker is a fully authentic exhibition, displaying the 
        HQ as it would have been in full readiness for a nuclear war. In 1998 
        'The Bunker Preservation Trust' took over the management of the site, 
        preserving it as a Charity for future generations to visit. <br>

      <p>During a time of tension the UK would be divided into 18 regions, each 
        with it's own Regional Government HQ (RGHQ), to carry on the business 
        of government up to and after an attack. All these headquarters worked 
        on the principle of an escalation of international tension, leading up 
        to a nuclear strike, giving them a few weeks or months to prepare. In 
        the event of a sudden unpredicted attack there would have been literally 
        no defence.</p>

  <tr align="left" valign="top"> 
    <td colspan="2" height="231"> 
      <p class="s_bluebody">Each of the RGHQs would have a senior civil servant 
        (Regional Commissioner) in charge. They would control the whole region 
        and be in constant touch with the UK Combined Headquarters, the Military 
        and all other relevant HQs. As their only function was civilian government, 
        they would report to and take their orders directly from the Cabinet War 
        Office and the Prime Minister, who would be located along with the joint 
        Chiefs at either the UK Combined HQ or airborne in a flying command centre. 
        These national HQs are all 'state of the art' facilities and remain operational 
        today.</p>
      <p class="s_bluebody">Volunteers would go out from the regional centre to 
        take radiation readings throughout the county and civil defence staff 
        would undertake the tasks of evacuation, rescue and warning. All this 
        vital work for the county of Essex would be co-ordinated from the County 
        Emergency HQ. Their prime purpose was to ensure that, in the aftermath 
        of a nuclear strike, as many lives as possible were saved and to make 
        life as acceptable as possible for local people, until things started 
        to return to normal and the central services could take over again.</p>
      <p><span class="s_bluebody">Fortunately, the system was never put to the 
        test and with the ending of the Cold War in the early 90s it is hoped 
        that FURZE HILL, and places like it, will never be needed again.</span></p>
