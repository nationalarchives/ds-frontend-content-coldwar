      <p class="s_greenbody"><span class="s_greenbody">Britain got its first Labour 
        government in 1924, although it only lasted a year. During the 1920s Britain 
        was a deeply divided society. Trade unions and workers (friends of the 
        Labour Party) clashed with employers and the government (friends of the 
        Conservative Party) over many issues. </span></p>
      <p class="s_greenbody">One of these issues was relations between Britain 
        and Communist Russia (soon to be renamed the USSR). The Conservative government 
        refused to have any contact with the USSR. The Labour Prime Minister, 
        Ramsay MacDonald, changed this policy. He signed a number of business 
        agreements with the USSR. He also proposed a treaty between Britain and 
        the USSR that would establish official relations between the two countries. 
        It would also give the Soviet Union a large loan to help it develop its 
        economy. </p>
      <p class="s_greenbody">Many of Labour's opponents tried to discredit Labour 
        by claiming that it was full of Russian Communist agents. Late in 1924 
        it looked like Parliament might reject MacDonald's plans for a treaty 
        with the USSR. MacDonald was so fed up with criticisms of his government 
        that he called another election late in 1924. </p>
      <p class="s_greenbody">During the election (in October 1924) there was a 
        major controversy. The press got hold of a letter written by Zinoviev 
        to the British Communist Party. Zinoviev was head of the Comintern. This 
        was an organisation whose job was to spread Communism across the world. 
        The letter was written to the British Communist Party. It seemed to suggest 
        that Russian and British Communists were keen on MacDonald's treaty because 
        it would help them get more agents into Britain. </p>
      <p class="s_greenbody">Historians are not sure how much effect the letter 
        had, but Labour lost the election and the Conservatives, who opposed MacDonald's 
        treaty plans, won the election by a long way. </p>

        Russia in Britain in the 1920s? Click on the sources to see for yourself.
