<p>To the Central committee, British Communist Party </p>
<p>(Very Secret)</p>
<p>Moscow, September 15, 1924</p>
<p>Dear Comrades, </p>
<p>The time is approaching for the Parliament of England to consider the treaty
  concluded between the governments of Great Britain and the SSSR for the purpose
  of ratification. </p>
<p>The fierce campaign raised by the British bourgeoisie around the question shows
  that the majority of the same, together with reactionary circles, are against
  the treaty </p>
<p>for the purposes of breaking off an agreement consolidating the ties between
  the proletariats of the two countries leading to the restoration of normal relations
  between England and the SSSR. </p>
<p>&#133; In the meanwhile, however, strain every nerve in the struggle for ratification
  of the treaty, in favour of a continuation of negotiations regarding the regulation
  of relations between the SSSR and England. </p>
<p>A settlement of relations between the two countries will assist in the revolutionising
  of the international and British proletariat not less than a successful rising
  in any of the working districts in England, </p>
<p>as the establishment of a close contact between the British and Russian proletariat,
  the exchange of delegations and workers etc, will make it possible for us to
  extend and develop the propaganda of ideas of Leninism in England and the colonies.
