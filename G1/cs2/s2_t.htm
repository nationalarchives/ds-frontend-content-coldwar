<p>It is quite true - and we have always felt - that we get nothing out of the
  Soviet government by any remonstrances (protests) simply because these quite
  shameless liars merely deny everything however clearly established (in other
  words, even though there is overwhelming proof). On the other hand, there is
  much force in the view that our best and only defence against these treacherous
  proceedings is publicity (<i>in other words, publishing the Zinoviev letter</i>).
  It does not seem fair to our own people (<i>the people of Britain</i>) that
  our (<i>the government's</i>) knowledge of these Russian machinations should
  remain forever concealed.<br>
  &#133;<br>
  It was agreed in virtue of the formula respecting propaganda, enclosed in the
  memorandum of the 29th May 1923 (see useful notes), that the Soviet government
  should not support with funds, or in any other form, persons or bodies or agencies
  or institutions whose aim is to spread discontent or to foment rebellion in
  any part of the British empire. We cannot really rest content with the ridiculous
  assertion of the Soviet Government that they give no support whatever to the
  Third International. </p>
<p>I think therefore that we should do two things: (1) address to M Rakovsky (Soviet
  representative in Britain) a formal note of protest with a request for the definite
  stoppage of this propaganda of the most violent and indefensible kind and (2)
  give full information to our press. <br>
