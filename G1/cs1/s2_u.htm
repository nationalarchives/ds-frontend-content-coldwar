  <li>Austen Chamberlain was Chancellor of the Exchequer in
    1919. He was also the brother of Neville Chamberlain (who is an important
    figure in Case Study 3).</li>
  <li>Andrew Bonar Law was Lord Privy Seal (a top Cabinet job)
    and also leader of the Conservative Party. </li>
  <li>Britain was feeling the strain of war by 1919. The First
    World War left Britain with heavy losses and huge debts, mainly to the USA.
  </li>
  <li>Bolsheviks and Communists are the same thing. </li>
  <li>By this time the USA was withdrawing its troops from
    Russia and the rest of Europe. </li>
  <li>The General Staff was made up of the top commanders of
    the Army and the Navy. It was their job to advise the politicians on military
    issues. It was also their job to plan and carry out the military actions that
    the politicians ordered. </li>
