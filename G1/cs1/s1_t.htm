<p><span class="letter_body"> </span>Mr Churchill, continuing, said that the War
  Cabinet must face the fact that the North of Russia would be over-run by Bolsheviks,
  and many people would be murdered. He was increasingly distressed with the way
  the situation had developed since the Armistice. Everything was going wrong.
  The continued disheartening of the Russian forces friendly to us had led to
  a great falling off in their morale. When firing stopped (at the end of the
  First World War), the Ukraine was occupied by the Germans. We requested them
  to withdraw, but we put in no Allied force there, and now that area, rich in
  food, was in the hands of the Bolsheviks. </p>
<p>The Bolsheviks were taking Nicholiev and Kherson, and were advancing on the
  Black Sea. Odessa might soon be invested [captured]. Four months had passed
  in a policy of drift, and great potential resources which might have helped
  us were being dissipated. It was idle to think we should escape by sitting still
  and doing nothing. Bolshevism was not sitting still. It was advancing, and unless
  the tide were resisted it would roll over Siberia until it reached the Japanese,
  and perhaps drive Denikin into the mountains, while the border Baltic states
  would be attacked and submerged. </p>
