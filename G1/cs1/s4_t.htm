Mr Barnes felt that Great Britain had fully discharged her obligations to these
peoples [in the Baltic States]. In his opinion, we were always backing the wrong
horse. The real governing force in Russia was the Soviet Government, and he asked
how long we were to continue to bolster up the various little States and temporary
governments such as Denikin's and Kolchak's. If we were to go on doing this, we
must get a guarantee from the United States that the Americans would stand in
with us.
