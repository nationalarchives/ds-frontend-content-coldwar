<p>Monsieur Bonnet and Lord Halifax in their recent conversations with MM Suritz
  and Maiski gave the latter no information which went beyond what was daily published
  in the press. There were no discussions and there was no agreement between the
  Soviet government on the one hand and the French and British on the other regarding
  the fate of Czechoslovakia and the question of concessions to the aggressor.
  Neither France nor Britain consulted the Soviet Union but simply informed the
  Soviet Government of already accomplished facts. The communiqu&eacute; concludes
  by repeating once again that the Soviet Government had nothing to do and has
  nothing to do with the Munich Conference and the decisions reached at it. </p>
<p>Both the Pravda and the Izvestiya, which had hitherto refrained from all comment
  on the Munich Conference and its results, to-day publish violent leading articles
  on the settlement which has been reached. After declaring that it must by now
  be clear to all that Mr Chamberlain and Monsieur Daladier did not, as they themselves
  pretend, save the peace of the world at Munich but rather accomplished an act
  of unparalleled shamelessness &#133;<br>
