<p align="center">SUMMARY OF TELEGRAMS</p>
</u>
<p><u>HUNGARY</u> We are proposing joint US, UK and Soviet examination of the
  Hungarian political situation since we feel the intervention of Soviet occupation
  authorities in the conspiracy case has precluded the possibility of a local
  settlement and threatens to render impossible the functioning of democratic
  processes in Hungary. Schoenfeld is to make clear our opposition to the Soviet
  action.</p>
<p><u>GREECE</u> The Greek Charge has presented the Department with a formal request
  for the &quot;financial and other assistance&quot; necessary to enable the Greek
  Government to purchase supplies of food and clothing and to enable the military
  and civil establishments to restore order within the country.</p>
<p><u>GERMANY</u>Ambassador Murphy is informed that we disapprove in principle
  of the recruitment of Germans into the armed forces of the United Nations or
  of any other powers. We hope that a settlement of this problem may be reached
  at the Moscow Conference.</p>
<p><u>RELIEF</u> We estimate the following emergency relief needs abroad following
  the end of the UNRRA program: Austria, $148 million; Greece, $56 million; Hungary,
  $40 million; Italy, $158 million; Poland, $128 million; and Trieste (on a tentative
  basis), $20 million. It is also felt that China may need $60 million in relief
  later in the year. It is believed that further relief would be unnecessary with
  the possible exception of Austria. <br>
