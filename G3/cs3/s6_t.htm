It is clear that the restoration and further development of the national economy
of European countries would be facilitated if the United states of America, whose
productive capacities have only not diminished during the war but have considerably
increased, could give that economic help which these countries require. At the
same time it is known that the USA herself is also interested in utilising her
credit possibilities for the expansion of her external markets &#133;
<p>Hitherto it has been regarded as axiomatic that every nation should decide
  the question of how best to secure the restoration and improvement of its economy.
  No European government intends to interfere in deciding whether the Monnet plan
  is good for France or not. This is the affair of the French people itself. But
  this also applies to Great Britain, to the Soviet union, to Poland and to Czechoslovakia,
  and to every other European country &#133;</p>
<p>&#133; working out an all embracing economic programme for European countries
  - which will inevitably lead to interference by certain countries in the affairs
  of other countries - cannot be accepted as a basis for cooperation for the countries
  of Europe. Such attempts are now being made by certain powers, but they are
  doomed to failure and will only undermine the international authority of those
  powers. <br>
