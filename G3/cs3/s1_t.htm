</p>
<p>The peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had totalitarian
  regimes forced upon them against their will. The Government of the United States
  has made frequent protests against coercion and intimidation, in violation of
  the Yalta agreement, in Poland, Rumania, and Bulgaria. I must also state that
  in a number of other countries there have been similar developments.
<p>At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between
  alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one.</p>
<p>One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished
  by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees
  of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political
  oppression.</p>
<p>The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed
  upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press
  and radio; fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms.</p>
<p>I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples
  who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.<br>
  I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in
  their own way.</p>
<p>I believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial
  aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes.<br>
