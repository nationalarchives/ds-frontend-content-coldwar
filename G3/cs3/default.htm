      <p class="s_greenbody" >Did US President Harry Truman cause the Cold War? 
        The two events most associated with Truman and the Cold War are the Truman 
        Doctrine and the Marshall Plan.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="s_greenbody">The Truman Doctrine emerged in a speech in March 
          1947. In this speech Truman promised help to any country fighting a 
          Communist takeover. The policy became known as Containment of Communism. 
        </li>
        <li class="s_greenbody">The Marshall Plan was a major programme of economic 
          aid offered to all European states to help them recover from the war. 
          In the end, only the Western democracies got any aid. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="s_greenbody">For may years Soviet and Western historians interpreted 
        Truman's actions differently.</p> 
      <ul>
        <li class="s_greenbody">The Soviet view was that Truman was an aggressor. 
          The Truman Doctrine essentially meant giving money and weapons to enemies 
          of the USSR. </li>
        <li class="s_greenbody">The Marshall Plan was an attempt to get all of 
          Europe in debt to the USA and allow the Americans to dominate it. The 
          American view was that the Truman Doctrine was stopping the continuing 
          spread of Communism. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="s_greenbody">The Marshall Plan was partly an act of generosity, 
        partly an act of self interest - America wanted Europe to recover so Americans 
        would have partners to trade with. </p>
      <p class="s_greenbody">In recent times more evidence has emerged from the 
        Soviet archives. We have a clearer picture of the misunderstandings and 
        suspicions of the period. This extract is from a paper written by an American 
        academic historian.</p>

        In general, the new evidence supports the overall thrust of the arguments 
        that Soviet policy in 1947 was largely defensive and reactive &#133; U.S. 
        officials felt embattled in the spring of 1947, and feared that the deteriorating 
        economic situation in Western Europe could lead to communists coming</i> 
        <i>to power in such countries as France and Italy. If this were to happen, 
        American security would be threatened.</i> </span><i>Prior to the summer 
        of </i><i>1947, then, available &#133; evidence suggests that Stalin still 
        hoped to pursue a variant of detente [co-operation] with the Western Powers 
        &#133; The Marshall Plan, however, radically changed Stalin's calculus, 
        and led him to shift away from this more moderate line &#133; The new 
        archival documentation shows that in making this shift, the Soviet leadership 
        was moved primarily by fear of its own vulnerability to American economic 
        power</i> </p>

      <ul>
        <li> So do you think that Truman caused the Cold War by failing to realise 
          that Stalin was threatened?</li>
        <li>Or do you think that Stalin caused the Cold War by mistrusting the 
          Americans? </li>
        <li>And what role did Britain play in all of this?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your task is to examine the sources in this case study and reach your 
        own decision. </p>
      <p> The worksheet should help you to keep your ideas together.</p>
