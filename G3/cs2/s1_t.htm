It is also an honour, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps almost unique &#133; that
the President has travelled a thousand miles to dignify and magnify our meeting
here to-day&#133;
<p>The President has told you that it is his wish, as I am sure it is yours, that
  I should have full liberty to give my true and faithful counsel in these anxious
  and baffling times. I shall certainly avail myself of this freedom &#133; Let
  me however make it clear that I have no official mission or status of any kind,
  and that I speak only for myself.</p>
<p>A shadow has fallen upon the scenes so lately lighted by the Allied victory.
  Nobody knows what Soviet Russia and its Communist international organization
  intends to do in the immediate future &#133;</p>
<p>&#133; We understand the Russian need to be secure on her western frontiers
  by the removal of all possibility of German aggression. We welcome Russia to
  her rightful place among the leading nations of the world &#133; It is my duty
  however, for I am sure you would wish me to state the facts as I see them to
  you, to place before you certain facts about the present position in Europe.</p>
<p>From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended
  across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states
  of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade,
  Bucharest and Sofia, all these famous cities and the populations around them
  lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one form or
  another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and, in some cases,
  increasing measure of control from Moscow.</p>
<p>The Communist parties, which were very small in all these Eastern States of
  Europe, have been raised to pre-eminence and power far beyond their numbers
  and are seeking everywhere to obtain totalitarian control. Police governments
  are prevailing in nearly every case, and so far, except in Czechoslovakia, there
  is no true democracy. </p>
<p>Turkey and Persia are both profoundly alarmed and disturbed at the claims which
  are being made upon them and at the pressure being exerted by the Moscow Government.
  An attempt is being made by the Russians in Berlin to build up a quasi-Communist
  party in their zone of occupied Germany by showing special favors to groups
  of left-wing German leaders. </p>
<p>From what I have seen of our Russian friends and Allies during the war, I am
  convinced that there is nothing they admire so much as strength, and there is
  nothing for which they have less respect than for weakness, especially military
  weakness. For that reason the old doctrine of a balance of power is unsound.
  We cannot afford, if we can help it, to work on narrow margins, offering temptations
  to a trial of strength. If the Western Democracies stand together in strict
  adherence to the principles of the United Nations charter, their influence for
  furthering these principles will be immense and no one is likely to molest them.
  If however they become divided or falter in their duty and if these all-important
  years are allowed to slip away then indeed catastrophe may overwhelm us all.</p>
