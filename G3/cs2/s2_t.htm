<p> 1 The troubled debate about the Soviet Union's intentions and United States
  foreign policy continues. The Soviet's disregard of Allied agreements about
  Persia and alarming first-hand accounts from American journalists of conditions
  in Manchuria have heightened the feeling of concern. Mr Churchill's dramatically
  blunt review of the world situation in his speech at Fulton, Missouri, has made
  a very profound impact on the country and is being widely and heatedly discussed
  &#133;</p>
<p>2 Reactions to this situation vary. Tough-minded Conservatives in the War and
  Navy Departments talk about the inevitability of a showdown with the Soviet
  Union and hint that it may be better now than later. Internationalists clutch
  at United Nations Organisation with a new devotion born of desperation, while
  others turn, half fearfully and half hopefully, to another conference of the
  three Great Powers as a final attempt to hammer out a new basis of co-operation.</p>
<p>&#133; </p>
<p>4 It is generally assumed that both President Truman and His Majesty's government
  were privy to Mr. Churchill's speech in Missouri, and that fact, in addition
  to Mr. Churchill's own exceptional appeal to Americans, has resulted in the
  keenest attention being paid to the speech throughout the country. Although
  the bulk of the press and of Congress are clearly unwilling to endorse it as
  an adequate solution to present troubles, it has given the sharpest jolt to
  American thinking of any utterance since the end of the war.</p>
<p><br>
  7 But Americans really listen to Mr, Churchill and there is little doubt that
  the speech will set the pattern of discussion on world affairs for some time
  to come. While it is now plain that proposals tending towards an Anglo -American
  alliance can hardly expect approval if they come from British spokesmen, it
  seems possible that similar opinions if expressed by Americans might find a
  more positive reception, especially if Soviet expansionist tendencies continue.
  And if Mr Churchill's views are not at this stage acceptable to the generality
  of press and Congressional opinion, President Truman and Admiral Leahy were
  described as very warn in ' their compliments to Mr Churchill after he had spoken.
