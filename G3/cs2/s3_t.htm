The counterblast [to Churchill's speech] has come, but it is ostensibly directed
only against Mr. Churchill personally. For once His Majesty's Government and official
British foreign policy are spared although I doubt whether the Soviet public draws
the distinction and is much comforted by this....
<p>2. Pravda, only paper appearing today, carried on the back page a two and a
  half column summary of Mr. Churchill's speech which is on the whole fair and
  full &#133; </p>
<p>4. Most significant omission however was Mr Churchill's reference to his unavailing
  warnings before the war [when Churchill warned of the dangers of Hitler and
  opposed Appeasement]. This is replaced by comment that he made 'monstrous comparisons'
  [ie comparing the USSR in the 1940s with Germany in the 1930s]. His reference
  to Russian admiration of strength was also dismissed as a cynical statement
  designed to support his propaganda for an Anglo-American alliance.....</p>
<p>5. On the front page Pravda carries a two and a half column editorial entitled
  &quot;Churchill rattles the sabre [threatens war]&quot; bitterly attacking his
  speech. He is accused of having concealed his true views during the war and
  now returned to his old prejudices against the Soviet Union and the bogey of
  Bolshevik expansion dating from the time when he was a leading foreign interventionist.
  His conception of an Anglo-American military alliance is castigated as a reactionary
  plot against the Soviet Union, which would mean the end of the Big Three and
  of the United Nations Organisation. </p>
<p>6. The Pravda article has caused a sensation in Moscow. It is being read everywhere
  with unusual interest and there is considerable disquiet among the general public.
  Mr Churchill had been built up here during and after the war as a friend of
  Stalin and the Soviet Union and he enjoyed the sincere regard and indeed affection
  of the Soviet public. </p>
<p>7. My own impression is that the Soviet authorities were much taken aback by
  this frank statement by Churchill. They seem genuinely alarmed by many recent
  signs of American rapprochement with Britain &#133;</p>
<p>Finally a gigantic red herring of this is of the greatest help with the Soviet
  public and possibly also with public opinion in directing attention from Persia,
  and Manchuria.... In effect Churchill's speech is being used, to justify the
  warnings about capitalist encirclement contained in recent Soviet propaganda
  and more particularly in the election speeches here.</p>
