<ul>
  <li>This is a report from a Foreign Office observer in Moscow
    soon after Churchill's speech.</li>
  <li>The Soviet public got to read the speech in the Soviet
    newspaper Pravda. About a week later Stalin gave an interview in Pravda responding
    to the speech. </li>
  <li>It is worth remembering that the United Nations Organisation
    was very new in 1946. There was still a lot of doubt about whether it would
    work. </li>
  <li>You may have studied Case Study 1 in Gallery 1. In this
    you can read about Churchill's involvement in sending British forces to help
    with the attempt to defeat the Communists in the Russian Civil War of 1918-21. </li>
