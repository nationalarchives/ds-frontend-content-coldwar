Every now and again official representatives of the USA and Britain accuse Hungary,
Rumania and Bulgaria of violating the peace treaties. Recently such accusations
were made by the US State Department and the British Minister of state, McNeil.
Both asserted that these countries were not observing the peace treaties which
bound them to safeguard human rights and economic interests of the UN and their
citizens in these countries. Well, these accusations are absolutely groundless.
<p>In reality, all these countries are strictly observing the terms of the peace
  treaties. Human rights are not violated in any of them. Political freedom is
  secured to all citizens irrespective of race, sex, nationality or creed. These
  rights are embodied in the new constitutions and the possibility of exercising
  them is safeguarded. Racial discrimination is a crime punishable by law. Women
  enjoy the same rights as men. There is full freedom of conscience. Freedom of
  assembly, organisation and the press is secured. The overwhelming majority of
  the working people of these countries is organised in political TU [Trade Union],
  cultural and cooperative unions and associations on a democratic basis. There
  is no censorship in Rumania, Bulgaria and Hungary. An enormous number of newspapers
  and magazines of the most varied trends are published in the three countries.
</p>
<p>When the US state Department and the British Minister McNeil speak of Hungary,
  Rumania and Bulgaria violating the peace treaty relating to human rights, they
  are obviously not thinking of honest citizens of these countries who enjoy full
  political freedom, but of their own agents, spies and wreckers. McNeil even
  named the people he had in mind. These are the reactionary Fascist groups and
  gangs who have been convicted of subversive terroristic activities, designed
  to overthrow the people's democratic governments of these countries. But the
  governments of Rumania, Hungary and Bulgaria in no way violated the peace treaties
  when they adopted measures to frustrate the criminal, anti democratic activities
  of Maniu, Petkov, Nagy and their like. On the contrary, these governments acted
  in full accordance with the treaties, which bind them not to suffer the existence
  or the activity of organisations of Fascist type &#133;</p>
