<p>The following circumstances should not be forgotten. The Germans made their
  invasion of the USSR through Finland, Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria and Hungary.
  The Germans were able to make their invasion through these countries because,
  at the time, governments hostile to the Soviet Union existed in these countries
  ... </p>
<p>Possibly in some quarters an inclination is felt to forget about these colossal
  sacrifices of the Soviet people who secured the liberation of Europe from the
  Hitlerite yoke. But the Soviet Union cannot forget about them. And so what can
  there be surprising about the fact that the Soviet Union, anxious for its future
  safety, is trying to see to it that governments loyal in their attitude to the
  Soviet Union should exist in these countries?</p>
<p>How can anyone who has not taken leave of his senses describe these peaceful
  aspirations of the Soviet Union as expansionist tendencies on the part of our
  state?</p>
