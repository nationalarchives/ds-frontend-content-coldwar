</p>
<p>I have set out in an earlier paper the steps that have been taken by Soviet
  Russia from the days of the war-time conferences until the present. </p>
<p>There is only one conclusion to draw. After all the efforts that have been 
  made and the appeasement that we followed to try and get a real friendly settlement 
  on a four power basis, not only is the Soviet Government not prepared at the 
  present stage to co-operate in any real sense with any non-Communist controlled 
  Government, but it is actively preparing to extend its hold over the remaining 
  part of continental Europe and, subsequently, over the Middle East and no doubt 
  the bulk of the Far East as well. In other words, physical control of the Eurasian 
  land mass and eventual control of the whole World Island is what the Politburo 
  is aiming at - no less a thing than that. The immensity of the aim should not 
  betray us into believing in its impracticability. Indeed, unless positive and 
  vigorous steps are shortly taken by those other states who are in a position 
  to take them, it may well be that within the next few months or even weeks the 
  Soviet Union will gain political and strategic advantages which will set the 
  great Communist machine in action, leading either to the establishment of a 
  world dictatorship or (more probably) to the collapse of organised society over 
  great stretches of the globe. <br>
